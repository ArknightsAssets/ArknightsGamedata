[name="Nymph"]Why are you looking at me like that... Wait, Ermi! Hey—!
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_869_1#10$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ermengarde"]Nymph~
[name="Ermengarde"]Help me out again, last time I swear. I really have too much to handle and that old tool doesn't really care. Please, you're the only one I can count on now...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#13$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]But...
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_869_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ermengarde"]You just need to find all the fragments and bring them back. I'll give you a nice, big reward if you do.
[name="Ermengarde"]I know you don't really lack anything, but I guarantee it'll be something you really want. And... it's something only I can give you, not even my master could.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]Well, don't keep me guessing. Just say what it is and I'll think it over.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_869_1#10$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ermengarde"]I can't tell you too much at the moment, but don't you worry, we Liches are a generous people.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#11$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]Hmph, is that really the proper attitude to ask for help? Anyone else would have walked away, but not this silly Djall. She just lets you walk all over her.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#17$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]So fine, I'll help you find these fragments, but do you have a map that can show where they are, Ermi? The kind with the little black dots floating around?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_869_1#11$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ermengarde"]Do you think Liches can just conjure things from thin air? Why would I have something so strange?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_869_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ermengarde"]But you have a point, you'd be chasing your own tail if I just sent you off to find the fragments with no help.
[name="Ermengarde"]Not to mention that you don't have anything that could actually contain the revenant fragments... Pass me that box thing of yours while I think for a second.
[name="Ermengarde"]I'll need some time to give this a few upgrades. Head home and rest for now. Once I'm done, I'll come find you.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#17$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]Eh? I thought this was a super urgent task.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_869_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ermengarde"]Oh, I wouldn't go that far. And once you have the right tool, you'll save far more time than the few hours it'll take me to make it.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]Fine, but I still hope you can think over the map thing a bit more. I'll put my box over here. See you later, Ermi!
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_869_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ermengarde"]A way to detect revenants... To isolate them... What if I dismantled this part...? No, that won't work...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]Ermi? I'm heading back now. I'll wait for your good news!
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_869_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ermengarde"]Eh? Oh, alright, bye-bye!

Nymph walks over to a quiet corner of the plaza and sits down on some steps.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nymph"]I should probably put you back where you belong, but getting to meet you was something really special... I'd better tell you what I need to say quick.
[name="Nymph"]I've always known you were real, ever since I was young. Everyone said you were just stories to scare little kids, but I always believed.
[name="Nymph"]Back then, there was a Babel camp right by my doorstep. Mom and Dad never let me wander too far, so I was always looking for the camp's doctors to play with.
[name="Nymph"]My favorite fairy tale was the future the Babel doctors told me about.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nymph"]And then... My Babel friends left without warning. One day I'd go look for them as usual, and there was just the field.
[name="Nymph"]I was really sad, so I cried and cried at the furnace node in the plaza, because everyone told me the underground pipes connected to it would carry my voice all the way to the great, big Soul Furnace.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#16$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nymph"]Now that I've seen, or heard you, I feel so happy. You really do exist and you've been protecting us and all of Kazdel this whole time and—

Nymph's eyes widen as a shadow slowly seeps out of the shimmering slag. It is barely a wisp, as faint as a cicada's wings, but at least he doesn't sound as angry as before.

After a long period of silence, that is the only word the slag says. Nymph doesn't quite understand the meaning.
Not too far away, the wandering singer plucks at his instrument and begins to sing a song of farewell, as promised.
