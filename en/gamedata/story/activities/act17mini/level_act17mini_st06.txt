The smoke disperses into a rippling cloud, like a stone being thrown into a pool of stagnant water. The revenant's trace fluctuations sweep across the area, drowning all of Kazdel in silence.

These... are the revenants' fragments. I remember now. I try bringing them together, but they keep escaping through my fingers, like stardust.
They are talking. There's one... two. A lot of voices slowly drawing near me. The coldness fades away, and the frigid ice burns bright. I can feel it—
Agitation, hatred, chaos... It's more than them not hearing my cries, they... are simply ignoring me. Ultimately, they are annoyed.
They want to... tear me apart.

[name="Tin Man"]Really? Let's see... 'In a New Kazdel, the Sarkaz help one another, and outsiders no longer have to crowd on the city outskirts.'
[name="Tin Man"]'People come here for better lives regardless of race, and there is no Royal Court anymore.' Pohl, did you write that?

[name="Tin Man"]Yes. Well... Your vision is pretty bold, Gargoyle. I'm afraid it may never come true.

[name="Mudrock"]A lot of people said the same thing a lot of years ago, to another Gargoyle.

[name="Nymph"](Whispers) Ermi, Ermi. Which step of the ceremony are we on?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_869_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Ermengarde"]We're not on <i>any</i> step. Ever since the ancestors showed up, I've completely lost control of this ceremony.
[name="Ermengarde"]Right now, the feeling I'm getting is that the ancestors are toying with us.

[name="Nymph"]Toying?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_869_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Ermengarde"]They seem to enjoy hearing a different kind of stories.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4151_tinman_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Tin Man"]Crashing to the earth, flying into the sky, no Royal Court, and an entire city turned to revenants... You people come up with some wild ideas. Do you really think—

[name="Nymph"]There's no such thing as 'the wrong path'.
[name="Nymph"]Nobody knows what form Kazdel will ultimately take, but all of us want the people here to live better lives.
[name="Nymph"]If life gets better, how could you call it the wrong path?
[name="Nymph"]Even if the path we end up taking is a treacherous one, it would be better than finding ourselves at a dead end, wouldn't it?

There is no response from the furnace core. The Tin Man looks down once again, all while his finger continues to rhythmically tap his other arm.
Nymph feels her heart beating faster, as the staff in her hand gets hotter.
Come on, hurry up and say something. Nymph glances at Crownie to plead for help, but she sees only a dark shadow in the distance.
