[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] We have a 'Special Front' testing area to evaluate how Rhodes Island's Operators work together in Combat Ops. You can go there to obtain combat supplies.
[Tutorial(target="buff_panel", searchBtnInChildren=true,            animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] These are combat supplies. We can station Operators on the Special Front to activate these supplies and gain buffs for our Kernel Breakthrough operations.
[Tutorial(target="enemy_panel", searchBtnInChildren=true,            animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Here are the enemies that will appear on the Special Front. We can review intel in advance and prepare for battle.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] To prevent further enemy attacks, we need to station Operators to defend specific locations on the Special Front. Operators stationed for defense cannot participate in Kernel Breakthrough operations or be selected for support.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] We can proactively withdraw Operators stationed on the Special Front and reassign them to other operations. However, without stationed Operators, the combat supplies will be deactivated. Therefore, swapping out stationed Operators is a better option than simply withdrawing them.
