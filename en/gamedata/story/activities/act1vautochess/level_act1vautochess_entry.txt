[name="Kal'tsit"]I have some ideas for Rhodes Island's defense systems.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]The specific measures are still under feasibility testing and require further development before they are ready for public discussion.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]That's why we're holding a closed-door meeting today. Rhodes Island requires your input.

[name="Kal'tsit"]Amiya, please brief Doctor on the details.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1037_amiya3_1#8$1",focus="m")]

[name="Amiya"]Rhodes Island has learned from previous assaults, and optimized its internal and external defenses.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1037_amiya3_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]Feedback from the Londinium incident suggests that these adjustments have been quite effective.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1037_amiya3_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]Even with a large number of personnel dispatched to support Londinium, the remaining Operators still managed to effectively organize and counter small-scale riots, ensuring the landship's safety.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1037_amiya3_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]This is the main reason Dr. Kal'tsit is thinking about further enhancing Rhodes Island's defense systems.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1037_amiya3_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]When faced with an attack from other landships, our preferred option is to rely on our speed and/or reconnaissance to avoid combat entirely.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1037_amiya3_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amiya"]However, sometimes combat is unavoidable. In which case we will need our Operators to be prepared for boarding battles on the outer platforms.
