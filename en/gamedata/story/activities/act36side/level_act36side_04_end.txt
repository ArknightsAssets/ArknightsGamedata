Chilchuck feels a mess of emotions welling up.
Panic and resignation wash over him—doom feels inevitable. His own party members are now in dire straits, and he is powerless to help them.
But he also feels a little angry...

Because the reason for their distress... is entirely their own damn fault!

Chilchuck is sure he only blinked once, but the trio suddenly appear near him.
The next second, they are by his side.
From his perspective, they seem to have moved in a flash, as if the holes in their faces swallowed the space between them.
Soon, they disappear into the depths of the forest.

Chilchuck stands still for a moment before breaking into a deep sigh.
He hears the Cyclops approaching behind him, and sees the puzzled look on the girl's face.
He does not wait or hesitate, but begins sprinting towards where his companions vanished.
He is too embarrassed to explain what happened here to the Cyclops and her sorrowful gaze.
They are his companions after all... of course he can't just watch them disappear for good like that.
