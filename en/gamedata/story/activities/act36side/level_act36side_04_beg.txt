[name="Laios"]Speaking of going north though, why do I feel like we've been wandering around in circles this whole time?
[name="Laios"]Haven't we already walked past here before?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4143_sensi_1#1$1",focus="m")]

[name="Laios"]What's wrong, Chilchuck?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4144_chilc_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Chilchuck"]Senshi's right. But the terrain here is making me feel uneasy.
[name="Chilchuck"]Like the land itself has been shifting the whole time...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4142_laios_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Laios"]You mean like the dungeon?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4144_chilc_1#12$1",focus="m")]
[name="Chilchuck"]Yeah, something like that. But while the dungeon is always changing on the inside, this place is... the entire forest seems to be changing.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4144_chilc_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Chilchuck"]Look, there's a cliff up ahead. I'll go scout the terrain.

[name="Laios"]What was that?
[Dialog]
[charslot]
The four look towards the source of the sound, and see a monster resembling a bull.
—Of course, they know by now to call it a 'hornbeast.'
A creature showing up in the forest should be a common sight, but this hornbeast has still drawn their attention... For one reason—
On its face is a black... black? No, it is a blank, an endless void.
The first thing that comes to mind is the galaxy of stars one can see in the night sky.
A cow with a void as its face. They find this reality hard to believe.
What's even more shocking is what lies dead center in the blank space. A circle.
An uncannily perfect circle.
A circle somehow even darker than the void surrounding it.
Darker than the night, deeper than the void.
But how can this dark circle seem to emit light?
Because it isn't. The circle is really a hole that sucks in all the light near it, to the point that it seems to be glowing.
Darker than the night, brighter than the light...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4142_laios_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Laios"]Well... this is a strange monster.
[name="Laios"]The void on its face doesn't seem to be part of its usual biology.

Laios immediately sprints towards Chilchuck on the cliff, but is one step too late—
Chilchuck tries to jump backward to catch the outstretched hand, but Laios fails to grab him and can only watch as the Half-foot falls off the cliff.
