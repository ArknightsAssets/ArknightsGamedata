The three head over to the cliff's edge at Chilchuck's cry. It is then they realize why there was a tinge of worry in his voice.
They see a giant, colossal ship.
It sails across the land, a vessel much larger than any seafaring ship they have seen before.
A massive construct of steel. A city. A... dungeon.
This is it. Rhodes Island.
