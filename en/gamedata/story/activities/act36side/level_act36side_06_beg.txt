In their swift fall downwards, the hunters look just like—
—Shooting stars.
A sight that those who live in the deep seas rarely have the opportunity to witness.
With his desires and plans clouding his head, the bishop has, of course, never looked up at the night sky to enjoy that spectacle.
But they are different.
When the Abyssal Hunters had to fight for their lives and escape from the melancholy and sacrifice, they swam upwards, and when they finally reached the surface, they could only solemnly gaze upon the star-filled night sky...
The Hunters have all etched the destinies of these short-lived stars into their hearts.
Despite everything, the darkness can still be broken.

Three shooting stars illuminate the deep passageway.
The bishop is horrified. But because it has neither lungs nor vocal tracts, this thundering sound is as close as it gets to a scream for its current body.
Amidst the debris and crumbling walls, the monster's bloated, dying form sprawls across much of the karst cave. Once emanating a strange, eerie beauty, its bizarre body now begins to stiffen in dread as it faces impending doom.
