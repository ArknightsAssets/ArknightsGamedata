[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_010",focus="m")]
[name="Big Bob"]Well, that's good to hear. I was planning to bottle and sell it, so I brewed a couple batches. Sounds like I'll be raking in the dough.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4144_chilc_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Chilchuck"]Originium slug beer? Is it brewed with the slugs? How does that work?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_010",focus="m")]
[name="Big Bob"]There are many ways. If you raise them in clean wheat husks from the moment they're born, the husks will stick to them, and eventually they'll form shells that keep the smell.
[name="Big Bob"]And if you mix those shells into your brew's hops, this beer is what you'll get.
[name="Big Bob"]A few other places do it differently. Say, feeding the slugs hops and using their mucus in the brew.
[name="Big Bob"]I'm sure it'd taste different, but I like my brews the best!
[name="Big Bob"]The same goes for the pancakes you just had. Give those shiny little fellas some fruit, and their shells will end up sweet.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4142_laios_1#6$1",focus="m")]

Big Bob quickly packs up some prepared slug meat and beer and hands them over to Laios, along with a book.
Laios flips through the book and finds it filled with crooked, illegible letters.

[name="Big Bob"]Heh, that's my 'Bob's Gourmet Guide.' I wrote down everything I've seen and whether it's edible or not.
