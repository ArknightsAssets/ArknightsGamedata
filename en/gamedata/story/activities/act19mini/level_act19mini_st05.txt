For so many years, I've used the sword, washed it, used it again. Nightmares and waking up from them... it seemed like there was nothing else in my life.
The sword does not remember the blood that it has tasted, but I can never shake the sin... perhaps losing my sword was a sign from Heaven.
I will rid myself of the sword and the status it brought me. Perhaps I'll change my face and name, and find a quiet place to live out the rest of my days... I'll leave the jianghu and bid farewell to my life before.
That's why I can't teach you.
The tidings of fate have brought us together in this tiny teahouse. If you don't mind me being a busybody, I have a word of advice for you... don't learn the ways of the sword, and cut all ties with the jianghu.

[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]Why?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#6$2",focus="none")]
For twenty years I've worked for both the law and the underworld. There must be countless warrants and bounties on my head, but there's one thing I can be sure—
Whether they're trying to catch people's attention, or hide their true aim... the name of the Delivering Blade is convenient for them.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#6$2",focus="m")]
[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]......
[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]Which means the Delivering Blade can never escape the jianghu.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#6$2",focus="none")]
Funny, isn't it?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#6$2",focus="m")]
[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]You're concerned?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#6$2",focus="none")]
It's been six years since I lost my sword. This was a sign from Heaven for me to distance myself from all this... and I almost succeeded.
When I first set foot into the jianghu, I just wanted to make a living by the sword while doing a few good deeds along the way. But the further I went, the less my will was my own.
It's only now that I realize the jianghu is a vortex, a gigantic vortex, and there's only one way out of it—
Don't get sucked in, in the first place.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#6$2",focus="m")]
[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]You're in pain.
[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]I've never seen you like this before.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#6$2",focus="none")]

[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]Me?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#1$2",focus="none")]
...It's true. You could have killed me if you wanted to, just now.
Your skills have improved tremendously over the last few years.
No secret tomes, no teacher, not even a sparring partner in this little town. You've come this far on your own talent alone...
You don't even feel surprised or confused about all that's happened to me. Your mental attainment, too, is far beyond the ordinary.
The first time we met, I tried to dissuade you from studying the sword, out of my own experiences alone. But perhaps...
Perhaps you're a true genius who belonged in the jianghu all along.
You should leave this town and see what lies outside.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#8$2",focus="m")]
[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]You're right.
[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]It's something that I must do.

[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]What is it?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1866_1#1$2",focus="none")]
Frankly, there aren't many who would be a match for you at this point. There's no need to linger in this tiny town. If you want to leave, you should.
We met each other by the tidings of fate. I would like to give you a present, if you'd take it—the name of the Delivering Blade.
Call yourself his student, even the Delivering Blade himself. I could even give you a token to prove it... the jianghu can be a treacherous place, after all, and it'll make life a lot easier for you.
You should go. Let's bring this annual meeting to an end.

[name="Lin Qingyan"]In your heart, did you really throw away your sword?
[name="Swordsman"]......
[name="Swordsman"]I don't know the answer.
[name="Swordsman"]But what you're doing is heartless, Tianshi Lin.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Heartless, is it?
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Are you still going to beg for mercy for her, even at this hour?
[name="Swordsman"]We saw each other one day of the year for seven years. I thought I was the one guiding her, but it turns out it was the other way around.
[name="Swordsman"]It's true, I was a fool. I had thrown away my sword, only to pick it up time and again.
[name="Swordsman"]I don't know what I'm clinging to, or what I'm afraid of... maybe it's something I should figure out, in a remote village somewhere, or in a prison cell.
[name="Swordsman"]I'll pay for all the damage she caused, then I'll turn myself in. Before that, though, please...
[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"]......
[name="Sword-Bearing Woman"](Frenzied muttering)
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Look at her. She can't hear you anymore.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]She has engaged in too much violence to obtain the book. Malice will overcome her mind, even if the thunder of Heaven does not strike.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]But she will never truly be human, even if Lei Fa manages to rid her of geisthood.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]The living suffer much and think much. But the geists formed from inanimate objects are often simple of mind... it is difficult for them to truly become part of society.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Is it an act of kindness to bring them into this world, or an act of cruelty?
[name="Lin Qingyan"](Perhaps you should beg the Tianshi Bureaus' forgiveness when all is said and done, Lin Qingyan...)
[name="Swordsman"]But...
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Enough talk. As both the Deputy Minister of the Judicial Review Office, and disciple of the Tianshi Bureaus—this thunder must strike!
