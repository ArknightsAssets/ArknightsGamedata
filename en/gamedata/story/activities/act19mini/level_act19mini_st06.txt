Huai Tianpei matches 'Shuo' move for move, continuing to step forward. With each exchange, 'Shuo' becomes more corporeal, more real.
One round after another. Finally, Huai Tianpei stands at the summit, gazing up at the illusion's wrath.

Yun Qingping flips open his Record of Martial Combat, to the page where he recorded that duel for the ages. He still remembers the final punch, which could not be described with language.
[name="Yun Qingping"]Master Huai has taken another step forward...
Simplicity is perfection. It is a simple thing to understand.
But with life and death on the line, how many could set aside their ego, set aside themselves, cutting everything down to its most simple elements: a single punch or kick at exactly the right time, be it in offense or in defense.
Kung fu has become an inherent part of him, in his limbs, in his muscles, in his viscera.
Thirty rounds have passed. Huai Tianpei still stands.
The power of the punches have left two deep ditches in the boulder beneath his feet.
But he can go no further forward. One more step, and he will fall off the cliff.
Huai Tianpei shows no intention of backing down.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]No... he's in danger!
But who dares intervene in such a duel? Who can?
