The sound of the boy's footsteps slowly fades away. Night falls upon the weiqi board. Sunlight falls upon the stones. Rain and snow wash the stone benches.
Lan Ke picks up a white stone. He nearly places it down, but retracts his hand. Half a day later, he finally throws the stone back into its bowl.
His tenth dead end. He keeps it clear in his memory.
Time for yet another round of calculation. This time, he must come up with some wondrous move or the other to triumph.
