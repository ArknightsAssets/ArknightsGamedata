[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1043_leizi2_1#1$1",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1043_leizi2_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]While making my inquires about the deceased, a lot of townsfolk said they knew <i>of</i> a Hu Jun, and that you and this Hu Jun were apparently well-acquainted.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]What plagues me as odd is I reside in Baizao most of the time, just a stone's throw away from the foot of Mt. Mang, yet I've never heard anyone mention Mangshan Town.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]And there's not a single official tending to the town. Everyone resolves their disputes here instead, at your 'School'.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1043_leizi2_1#1$1",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1867_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Mr. Pu"]Nonsense... nonsense...
[name="Mr. Pu"]Tianshi Lin, I can answer all your questions now...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1867_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Mr. Pu"]This town used to be lively, in the old days. But time marched on, and Baizao kept on building itself bigger and bigger, until all our youth ran off to the city to find work, and left our town population to dwindle.
[name="Mr. Pu"]We still hang onto the 'town' title, but fact is, we're only five hundred or so households. Factor in the nearby Tianshi Bureau, and we never <i>do</i> get disturbances. Hence why the imperial court left us be.
[name="Mr. Pu"]As for myself, I read a book or two in younger times, that's all. I was a penniless scholar without enough knowledge to pass any entrance exam, so all I could do was stay here, teach the children to read, and scrape by.
[name="Mr. Pu"]So it's been for years. The folks call me Mister like I'm a wise man. They come to me when they run into trouble or want a penny for my thoughts. Makes me feel like a house of cards.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1043_leizi2_1#3$1",focus="m")]

It's the dead of night, and Lin Qingyan walks through the empty streets. If anyone is out at this hour, they'll see something most curious.
Behind the Tianshi, at a distance of ten steps, a handbroom leans on the wall. And for reasons unknown, wherever she goes, the broom stays behind her by that exact distance.
But never mind why a domestic handbroom is languishing outside; there's a single embroidered shoe on the roof too, pitter-pattering as it follows the broom, and then a calligraphed character on the wall, following that shoe.
And behind that, a jumping shoulder pole, a rolling medicine bottle, a clattering rattle drum... and at the very back of this bewildering procession, who should it be but Mr. Pu.
They all stop outside the door to an inn.

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1867_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mr. Pu"]Correct.
[name="Mr. Pu"]We all know about the power of Feranmut incarnations to possess objects, and Sui was all too powerful. Even suppressed by the town for a millennium, the mere might that leeched out of the cracks of the earth sufficed to turn some things geistly.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_1043_leizi2_1#1$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1867_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mr. Pu"]A Feranmutologist at the Sui Regulator. Decades ago, at that.
[name="Mr. Pu"]Life ends somewhere, and so does knowledge... My Feranmut studies were achingly incomplete, and the research had wicked away my own humanity. I handed in my resignation and left to live a secluded life in the mountains. That's when I found this town.
[name="Mr. Pu"]Decades ago, this town saw frequent possession incidents, which the Tianshi Bureau would send a Tianshi to quell if it felt like it.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1867_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mr. Pu"]But I had to feel sorry for geistkind, born into our secular realm not knowing up from down. And how steeped in humanity some were, their consciousness not so far from a human's.
[name="Mr. Pu"]Why simply watch them run amok and be crushed? Nothing stopped me from trying to teach them human rites and values. Maybe they'd even be able to coexist?
[name="Mr. Pu"]So little by little, this school came to be.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_1043_leizi2_1#1$1",focus="l")]
