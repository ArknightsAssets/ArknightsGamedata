Our tale begins in a modest teahouse, its building hardly tall enough for the two floors it's split into.
The interior is simply furnished, the space neither cramped nor bare. Ten wooden tables, meticulously laid out, seat six each. The tea stains have been scrubbed as much as they'll permit. It all speaks to a diligent owner.
The teahouse's server casts ladles of water across the floor, as he mops each and every tile to a mirror sheen.
It seems a while since this teahouse last welcomed a guest. One wonders what sort of customer could warrant such a conscientious welcome.
And with perfect timing, they come in.

Brain working in overtime, Hu Jun promptly flips the table up, cutting off Lin Qingyan's line of sight to him. It's just long enough for him to scramble like mad to the upper floor.

Lin Qingyan hurries out into the street, where a good few townsfolk are milling around to see what the commotion is.
She hears the single sharp strike. She sees someone crash through the upper floor window and fall to the road hard, right in front of the teahouse's entranceway.
She fully expects to see someone injured. Possibly even a corpse. But all that greets her eyes...
Is a pile of shattered teapot shards.
