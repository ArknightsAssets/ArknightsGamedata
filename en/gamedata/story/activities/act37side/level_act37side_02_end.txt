In the darkness where even the passage of time became blurred, she had sought to die in the ruins of history, to be forgotten by all those whom she disappointed, yet she was afraid to die, afraid to be forgotten.
But when muddy water dripped from the hole that the Steam Knight left behind and fell upon her palm, she opened her eyes and saw light.
What lay at the end of the light was life, and submission again.
Her hesitation may have lasted three days, or three minutes... in the end, she made the same choice as she once did.

[name="Eliseo"]Have you been to the Center for Biological Infection Control? More and more citizens whose conditions are deteriorating rapidly are being sent there by the day.
[name="Eliseo"]Most Londiniers didn't know how to handle acute Oripathy attacks before the war. The ones who need help the most are the ones getting the least of it.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_487_bobb_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Eliseo"]They can't afford to wait... not to mention the proliferation of drugs that have little actual effectiveness...

[name="Diane"]To save us?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_487_bobb_1#7$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_487_bobb_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Eliseo"]I-I mean no offense. I'm grateful that you've put a roof over my head, but I also see there's nothing but chaos in the matter of helping the Infected here.
[name="Eliseo"]I get that it takes time to build up and improve systems and workflows. Please understand, though, that it was my job to raise such issues, back in Columbia.
[name="Eliseo"]I just want to see more regulated and effective workflow to provide help to more Infected. And if I may say so, we're a little ahead on that front.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1519_1#8$1",focus="l")]

[name="Diane"]I would love to see it, if I get the chance.
[name="Diane"]But that gentleman has done nothing wrong. He has done what was tasked of him in such cases; in fact, he has done it better than any of his predecessors.

Through the window, Eliseo sees Vina Victoria for the first time.
He has done his homework, and heard the legends of the young Speaker during the war.
He thought the Speaker would be more impressive.
When he sees the well-dressed Aslan speaking at the podium, he feels nothing but disappointment—
Vina Victoria is not nearly as splendid as he imagined.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4110_delphn_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Delphine"]She could have stayed in Normandy, far from danger, but she came of her own accord to the chaos of Londinium in order to help the people here.
[name="Delphine"]She refused to stop working, even as her condition deteriorated, trying to help as many people as she could. Just like you, Eliseo.
[name="Delphine"]Our conflict with her was only because of the harm that her radicalness and stubbornness were doing to herself.
[name="Delphine"]There are no dark secrets, no conspiracies behind her passing. She was not a 'victim'.
