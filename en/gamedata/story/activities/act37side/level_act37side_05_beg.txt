[name="Catherine"]You're not going with them? Londinium isn't a great place for Infected anymore.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_864_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Percival"]'Isn't a great place.' Spoken with true Londinier irony.

[name="Percival"]When I was little, I was fascinated by the Londinium in the storybooks. The palaces and the gardens where the king and the young princess lived, the adventures to be found in the maze-like factories.
[name="Percival"]Now I find that Londinium is no different from anywhere else in Victoria. It's no place to make a home.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_864_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Percival"]I stay because somebody has to, and I like doing good, honest work. Besides, the treatment of the Infected in Londinium today is... not terrible.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]Really?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_864_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Percival"]I followed them because they saved my life. I'm not like those who are ready to die, who've already figured out how to die for something worthwhile.
[name="Percival"]Besides, in the end, it usually isn't worthwhile. Nobody deserves to die.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]You saved a lot of lives. Thank you, on behalf of the workers.
[name="Catherine"]Stop by Highbury the next time you're passing out pamphlets in the city. I'll see right through that disguise.

[name="Percival"]...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]The goods check out. I'm off, then.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_864_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Percival"]One more thing, Catherine...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]Go ahead.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_864_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Percival"]...If the rocks hurt at night, I know a few techniques to make you feel better.
[name="Percival"]I think you know... our medicine doesn't work as well as the stuff from the big pharmas.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]Yes. It may fool the other workers, but it can't fool me. Same for most of the suppressants you can get in Londinium right now.
[name="Catherine"]At my age, though, I don't have too many lucid days ahead of me. And I guess you could say I've seen worse.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]One more day with my senses is one more thing I can do. That's plenty.

[name="Victorian Sergeant"]Our men have tracked down Reunion's hideouts outside the city, two major factories, and their supply routes.
[name="Victorian Sergeant"]Should we shut them down?

[name="Delphine"]...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4110_delphn_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Delphine"]No need. Based on available information, they are not a threat to the citizens of Londinium.
[name="Delphine"]Vina says she has personal reasons to be wary of Reunion.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4110_delphn_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Delphine"]But even she admits that they were a big help to us when they incited the citizens to oppose the dukes.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4110_delphn_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Delphine"]As for the gray market... just make sure we keep track of everything that's going on. Percival is not stupid. She knows what she's not supposed to touch.
[name="Delphine"]The Reunion threat is much diminished now that their main members have left Londinium. Continue to monitor the situation.
[name="Delphine"]I will even go so far as to say that establishing contact at a private level is an option, if there is consensus about improving the Infected situation.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_422_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Victorian Sergeant"]Understood. We will continue to monitor Reunion activity without taking direct action.

[name="Delphine"]I suppose I'm wasting you lot on this kind of work.
