[name="Vina"]I don't think so.
[name="Vina"]The dukes are never of one mind—they each have their own agenda. However, for the crown to go missing at the same time they're visiting Londinium? That's far too much of a coincidence.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_405_1#13$1",focus="m")]

[name="Horn"]To many people, the crown is extraordinarily important, no matter its current state.
[name="Horn"]It's been left untouched for over twenty years, but the people have not forgotten about it. In fact, they are more eager than ever for its return.

[name="Horn"]Now that Parliament is up and running and the dukes have willingly relinquished their authority, the people are all the more convinced that you've secured universal support.

[name="Morgan"]Delphine convinced the provisional court to hold the crown thief in the Defense Forces' detention quarters, for now.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_405_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Morgan"]The full report on her is out now. I didn't want to waste time, so I came straight to you. Here, this is the report.
[name="Morgan"]Her name is Diane Weber.

Morgan pauses, watching Vina closely for a reaction. But Vina simply looks at her with curiosity, waiting for her to continue.

[name="Morgan"]...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_405_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Morgan"]She didn't just decide to steal the crown out of the blue.
[name="Morgan"]She has been working with a pharmaceutical rep from Columbia for a while now, helping spread awareness about Oripathy infection protection methods.
[name="Morgan"]That's how she learned when the guards patrolling outside the Palace of Westhaleg would change shifts. Once she got inside, she waited until your speech and slipped into the throne room.
[name="Morgan"]And then, she stayed there for quite a while—at least half an hour.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1019_siege2_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Vina"]What did she do in there?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_405_1#13$1",focus="m")]
[name="Morgan"]I don't know, and she won't say. Maybe she was hesitating, or maybe she just got lost in thought. In any case, she managed to make off with the crown without alerting anyone.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1019_siege2_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Vina"]Wait, something doesn't add up here. She stayed in the throne chamber for so long. She didn't run into the patrols after the shift change?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_405_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Morgan"]No, she didn't. Even she was surprised by how easily she escaped. She thought for sure the patrols would catch her.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1019_siege2_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Vina"]So someone must have helped her. Was it one of the guests?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_405_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Morgan"]Unclear, but if she had help, she didn't know about it. She came up with this whole plan herself.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1019_siege2_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Vina"]But... why? Just to bring the crown to me and goad me into—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_405_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Morgan"]Her name is Diane Weber.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1019_siege2_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Vina"]I know—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_405_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Morgan"]You don't remember her. I kept thinking she looked familiar, and when I saw the report, I realized—it's her.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1019_siege2_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Vina"]...?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_405_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Morgan"]Remember that day when the alliance surrounded us on our doorstep? The first soldier to defy orders and escort us forward?

Vina recalled the sky that day, filled with steam, the lingering smell of smoke and gunpowder.
And the soldier whose face had become a blur in her memory.

The crown lets out a faint metallic creak as Vina's hand tightens around it. It looks so fragile, yet its resilience is undeniable.

[name="Morgan"]She really loved our home, and she loved Victoria as well.
