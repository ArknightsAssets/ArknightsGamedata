Shearer collapses on the street. The rays of the setting sun are not particularly bright, but they are enough to hurt his eyes.
Or, perhaps, it is his body's way of reminding him that only another deep-seated desire can mask the pain.
He tries to adjust his breathing, like he instructed the soldiers fighting pain during the war...
But he fails. He has already lost the fight.
Shearer sees fire. It is so hot he cannot open his eyes. The sky burns. The walls burn. He burns—

He sees the day when he lay on the ground beneath the walls.
The walls of Londinium burned with Draco fire, burning brighter and brighter, until the flames consumed the sky.
He cries out in fear, and tries to cover his eyes—

[name="Shearer"]...Lady Delphine?
[name="Delphine"]I have been waiting for you, Lieutenant.
[name="Delphine"]I saw the letter you wrote to Vina... but you avoided me, just like you refused my offer of treatment.
[name="Shearer"]She never read my letter... did she, Lady Delphine?
[name="Delphine"]I can guess what you wrote.
[name="Shearer"]...
[name="Delphine"]I'm sorry, but I can't help you here. We both know the state of medicine availability in Londinium. You can't stay here.
[name="Shearer"]Where can I go?
[name="Delphine"]Lynncardine.
[name="Shearer"]No! I...
[name="Delphine"]I wasn't asking, Lieutenant. This is an order. And don't give me that excuse about being retired.
[name="Delphine"]I know why you hesitate. I know what you fear.
[name="Delphine"]You're afraid to face the senior officers who betrayed and abandoned you at Irnclad Galavae...
[name="Delphine"]You're afraid that you won't come good on your loyalty to me and my mother, and you're afraid to return home like this. Aren't you?
[name="Shearer"]I... I don't know...
[name="Delphine"]You're not as strong as you think, Lieutenant. And I'm not as weak, or noble, as you think.
[name="Delphine"]Our home is Lynncardine. Not here.
[name="Delphine"]The war is over, Lieutenant. This soldier should go home.
[name="Shearer"]...
[name="Delphine"]Don't be afraid. I'm going home with you.
