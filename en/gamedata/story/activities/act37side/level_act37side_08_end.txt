[name="Emotional Worker"]Yes. She's the one who introduced us to you!

[name="Emotional Worker"]Speaker Vina, sorry. It's a force of habit. Speaker Vina must have made a mistake.

[name="Eliseo"]...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4110_delphn_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Delphine"]I saw that you requested to review Parliament's records, so you must be well aware of Diane's charges, the defense that she herself presented, and the various PMs' opinions of her.
[name="Delphine"]The citizenry has collectively established Londinium's current laws, and the provisional court made its judgment of Diane in accordance with those laws. Isn't this how you do things in Columbia?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_487_bobb_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Eliseo"]But she's a war hero—shouldn't her merits outweigh her faults?

[name="Delphine"]I often come across this phrase in history books, usually said by old Victorian kings.

[name="Delphine"]Parliament will not interfere with any of your endeavors. However, as far as Diane's case is concerned, I'm sorry—this is Parliament's decision, and it cannot be changed.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_487_bobb_1#7$1",focus="r")]
