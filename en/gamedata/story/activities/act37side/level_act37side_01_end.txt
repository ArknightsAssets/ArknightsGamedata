He looks all around him, watching the people on their benches whisper to one another uneasily, an unconscious sneer on his face.
This place fettered him, and in its magnanimity, it had also fettered those who would decide his fate.
Not too long ago, Vina vetoed a proposal to use the Palace of Westhaleg to house the Parliament, instead choosing this building oft rented out by the royal family.
