[name="Eliseo"]Ataxia. It's a common symptom of many Infected in Londinium, but I'm not sure what the cause is.

[name="Sanatorium Patient"]When I'm by myself, I've been trying to... it's strange. My Originium Arts seem to be changing.

[name="Eliseo"]The battle for the walls.
[name="Eliseo"]You said you were a nurse, and you were trying to stop a witchcraft bomb explosion with your Arts, but it didn't work out too well.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_418_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Sanatorium Patient"]Yes. I remember I was behind Lieutenant Shearer, and the blast threw me off my feet.
[name="Sanatorium Patient"]Next thing I remember, I was in the field hospital, lying next to the other acute Infected.
[name="Sanatorium Patient"]I don't know how many witchcraft bombs fell upon the Exemplars.
[name="Sanatorium Patient"]So many fates, turned on their heads in an instant... but I didn't see any of it, and I don't remember any of it... how could things be like this?

The patient is trembling, and begins to cast Originium Arts without realizing it.
Eliseo does not know if it is a symptom of post-traumatic stress, but he quickly attempts to direct her attention elsewhere.
