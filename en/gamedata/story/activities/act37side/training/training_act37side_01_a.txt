Vina says the streets have been restless lately. Prying eyes have been casing the freight cars.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_tiger")] Hah. They're just street thugs. No big threat there.
[Tutorial(protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_dagda", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
But if they rob the freight cars and get their hands on some new gear, they'll become a nuisance.

We should secure the cargo before that happens.

This equipment should come in handy. <@tu.kw>We just need to deploy Operators on the same plates as the equipment, </>and then we'll be able to use it.

Unequipped blades will increase your ATK.

Protective vests will increase your DEF.

With the assault Arts Unit, Operators can temporarily <@tu.kw>frighten</> enemies after using their Arts, dealing <@tu.kw>Arts Damage</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_morgan")] However, if those bandits get their hands on the equipment, they'll also be able to use it. We can't let that happen.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_morgan")] Enemies may look harmless, but after they put on equipment, they're no longer so easily dispatched.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_morgan")] If enemies are <@tu.kw>Frightened</>, their equipment will take more damage, i.e. they'll be easier to defeat. We can use this to our advantage.
[Tutorial(protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_tiger", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
Gah. We weren't able to recover all of the equipment in time. Stay sharp and prepare for battle.
