The first wave of purple flame came from the bow of the Gastrell, gushing towards the walls of Londinium. And again. And again.
Like the cold waves of death that splashed against the sheer cliffs of Iberia.
It fell upon the Nachzehrers before Shearer, burning away the rot.
Londinium's walls are alight, ignited by Draco fire.
The Sarkaz defenders became kindling for the purple inferno.
