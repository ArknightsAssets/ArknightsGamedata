[name="Catherine"]A giant thing? No. It has a name.
[name="Catherine"]The Crawler. My grandson designed it. Pretty good, huh?
The gray-haired pilot blows a smoke ring, standing proudly on the ladder of the massive machine.
It has four massive steam-powered hydraulic legs, encased in protective armor that bears the unmistakable signs of a worker's handiwork.
Smoke is still billowing from its enormous, black cannon barrel, a clear sign that it was the one responsible for the massive hole in the ground.
A steady stream of Self-Salvation Corps members emerge from the gaping hole beneath The Crawler, carrying combat supplies up to the surface.
[name="Vina"]You—
[name="Feist"]Siege, thank goodness we made it here in time!
[name="Feist"]Starting now, the Self-Salvation Corps will join forces with you. With Granny and her team helping out, we'll have a much greater chance of victory!
[name="Catherine"]We just got that message ourselves—it seems the timing is spot on.
[name="Vina"]I-Victoria thanks you!
[name="Vina"]Horn?
[name="Horn"]All clear. The preparations are complete, and we're ready to move out at any time.
[name="Vina"]Good.
[name="Vina"]Everyone, this is the final battle. We—
[name="Catherine"]Wait a minute. There's still one thing left.
[name="Catherine"]I need to adjust the cannon.... there. That should do it.
[name="Catherine"]Cover your ears!

The cannon strikes the giant bell at the center of Auchterigg, an ancient relic that had stood for centuries.
The bell tolls, loud, clear, and beautiful, followed by the sound of the alliance war horns and their furious battle cries.
[name="Catherine"]We've got to let certain people know we're here.
[name="Catherine"]You're in command now.
[name="Vina"]Victorians! Charge forth to our final victory!
