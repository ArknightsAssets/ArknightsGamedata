This is a Foldable Bastion that can be built into a Bastion Platform.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_stward")]It also needs three work shifts to be completed.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_stward")]Right, you can deploy high ground operators on Bastion Platforms, and they can also alter the enemy's path.

That facility in front...
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_stward")]That's a Foldable Defensive Barricade. It only needs one work shift to be activated.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_stward")]Once complete, it will turn into a Defensive Barricade that can obstruct the enemy's advance.

[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_stward")]You and your partner can activate Facilities together.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_stward")]The vehicle from earlier has brought us more maintainers, so we'll leave the rest of the Facilities to you, Doctor!
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_adnach")]The Rest Phase is the prime time for activating Facilities. Operators do not need to go on the field during this time.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_adnach")]When the next wave begins, we can deploy onto activated platforms and prepare for our bastion defense.
