[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")]Each match is divided into two stages, and each stage has its own objectives to complete.
[Tutorial(target="panel_cooperate_normal_status",\
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
The goal of this first stage is to Survive, so we need to hold off the enemy's attack until time runs out.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")]We're playing on the same field, but we each have our own Objective Point.
[Tutorial(focusX=-430, focusY=-70, focusWidth=150, focusHeight=150, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black=0.5, \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
Your own Objective Point is blue. If enemies enter it, you'll lose Life Points.
[Tutorial(focusX=430, focusY=-70, focusWidth=150, focusHeight=150, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black=0.5, \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
The green Objective Point belongs to your partner, so I'll have to defend it. I'll lose Life Points if enemies enter here.

[Tutorial(focusX=350, focusY=100, focusWidth=120, focusHeight=120, \

          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
Oh, right! Operators deployed by your partner will be marked with a special color, so you won't mix them up.
[Tutorial(focusX=0, focusY=-70, focusWidth=180, focusHeight=180, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black=0.5, \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
Finally, these highlighted Objective Points we'll have to defend together. Enemies will deduct both our Life Points if they get through.
