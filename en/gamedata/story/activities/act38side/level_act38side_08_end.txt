[name="Antonio"]Of course, the other famiglie are doing the same, but adapting to the rules of the new game is quite difficult.
[name="Antonio"]The Venezias can fit perfectly into both sets of laws, and we've been excelling at it.

[name="Antonio"]I was in a guerrilla force raiding a village under the Singas dynasty, but we were discovered, and the entire squad became captives.
[name="Antonio"]The twenty of us emptied every pocket and piled our possessions together to bribe the executioner to spare us, change our status from 'death penalty' to 'hard labor'.

[name="Antonio"]A so-called 'experimental ground', with a new order governing people from the old, vastly different from the Siracusan tradition...
[name="Antonio"]He knew people would have trouble adapting, irreconcilable conflicts would occur, and the system might even swallow groups of people in the process... but it couldn't be helped, there was a potential future.
[name="Antonio"]And all of that happened because four young people sat at the Grey Hall's round table and lobbied for their idea so passionately...
[name="Antonio"]Signora Sicilia allocated them one of Siracusa's twenty-three cities, without hesitation...
[name="Antonio"]A move so cavalier, like that aristocrat who circled half our names away.
[name="Antonio"]Papa, Leontuzzo was indeed quite sincere and inspiring at the time, but I almost lost control, I wanted to burst into laughter... That boy knows nothing at all.
