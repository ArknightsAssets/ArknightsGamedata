The sun is shining brightly.
The cordoned-off area has turned the bustling street quiet. Bloodstains mingle with the tire tracks on the ground as police officers rush back and forth.
Nuova Volsinii is not as rainy as the other cities in Siracusa. Without the rain to obscure it, the accident scene stands out all the more strikingly.

[name="Chatty Grooming Specialist"]Thank you. Heh.
[name="Chatty Grooming Specialist"]Our family has spent generations studying Lupo fur. We started as traveling craftsmen and eventually opened the first grooming center. It's been hundreds of years, and we've gathered plenty of expertise along the way!
[name="Chatty Grooming Specialist"]Lupo fur is generally coarse with inner and outer layers, while Perro fur is much finer and softer. At first glance, they may seem similar, but in reality, they're worlds apart.
[name="Chatty Grooming Specialist"]That's why I specially formulated this conditioning treatment for you. Its blend of rich botanical essences can help firm up the fur while still retaining key nutrients.

[name="Antonio"]First, keep an eye on everyone in the household. If anyone goes somewhere they shouldn't be going or is doing a job they shouldn't be doing, bring them to me immediately.
[name="Antonio"]Keep a close watch on the other famiglie in the city—the Saluzzos, the Medicis, the Leotis... Figure out which famiglia seems the most nervous. They're the ones who made the move on Leontuzzo.
