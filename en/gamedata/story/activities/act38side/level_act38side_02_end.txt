[name="Alberto"]A long time ago, I had a 'fratello'.
[name="Alberto"]We had a great relationship. We grew up together, sharing some of the dumbest moments of our youth. However, over time, a rift started to grow between us.
[name="Alberto"]I started learning to manage the family business and understanding the rules of Siracusa, but my fratello, sadly, wasn't interested in any of that.
[name="Alberto"]He was interested in Victorian literature, Leithanian music, and Siracusan plays. He spent most of his time in those silly theaters.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_686_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alberto"]The year I first took over the family business, I found his corpse in our parking lot.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_686_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alberto"]When I found him, I was enraged. I knew he was offending people, saying stupid things. I could have taken revenge, but I let it go.
[name="Alberto"]Do you know why?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_690_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name="Demetri"]Because you're a cold-blooded mafioso?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_686_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alberto"]Haha, I take no offense to your crudeness... but that's not quite the right answer.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_686_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alberto"]It's simple. Far too many people misunderstand the meaning of <i>famiglia.</i>
[name="Alberto"]Mafiosi are not 'duty-bound' to each other. They invest in each other and must work hard to protect those investments. Those with a common purpose and the determination to stand together can truly call themselves mafiosi.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_686_1#2$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_686_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Alberto"]I do not like to debate with other people. Business is all about finding mutual understanding.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1542_1#8$1", focus="r")]
[name="Eirene"]But this is a rare opportunity for you, no?
[name="Eirene"]In just a year's time, almost every major district in Nuova Volsinii will have a Venezia Trucking sales center or repair station.
[name="Eirene"]But if you have evidence that shows they are smuggling contraband, you can negotiate with them, or you could hand it over to City Hall, to smooth things over.
[name="Eirene"]Whichever option you choose, it will work out well for you. Am I wrong?

[name="Eirene"]I grew up in Sicilia. I haven't seen my parents since I was a child.
[name="Eirene"]The manager of a supermarket took me in when I was about 10 years old. He already had a daughter, but he treated me like his second one.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1542_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Eirene"]A little over a year ago, one of the smaller, local famiglie set fire to our supermarket, over a very minor dispute. As a result, my little sister contracted Oripathy.
[name="Eirene"]Later, I heard that small famiglia was completely wiped out by another larger famiglia that had entered Sicilia, simply because they refused to cede their territory. That larger famiglia's name? Saluzzo.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1542_1#4$1", focus="r")]

A faint vibration arises from beneath Noemi's feet—the sound of cargo landships from other cities docking with the support layers. It is steady and soothing, like the beating of a strong, healthy heart.
On the ground, containers stretch out like mountains, with trucks moving through the valleys between them. Cargo is being transferred from the support layers by crane for sorting, then transported by truck to various parts of the city.
Noemi still remembers the day Nuova Volsinii commenced operations. Signora Sicilia sent out a citywide message expressing her hopes and dreams for the new city.
This is the freight hub of Siracusa, the engine that shall power the nation's future.

[name="Eirene"]These giant floats are modeled after the mythical beasts from Siracusan legends. They're going to be the big surprise of the Carnevale. City Hall spent nearly six months preparing them.
[name="Eirene"]They will lead the Carnevale parade across the central avenue and through the entire city. Under the gaze of all the citizens, they will bring the festive atmosphere to its peak.
[name="Eirene"]The port officials have covered them with a tarp, so as not to ruin the surprise.

The crane's mechanical arm tears away the tarps, and the Carnevale floats begin rolling out, one by one.
The bizarre, gigantic beasts are exposed to the daylight, starting the grand parade ahead of schedule.
Before Eirene can even react, thick black smoke begins to rise at the end of the procession.

It is the 'wolf,' one of the legendary deities born of the wilderness. When the twin moons are high, the wolves sneak into Siracusans' dreams, invoking their primal nature and teaching them to survive.
This wolf is a symbol of Siracusa, its mysterious legends, its long, bloody history, and the limitless future that this new city holds.
But now, the 'deity' is bathed in flames, and Siracusa's future is slowly turning to ash.
[name="Busy Cop"]What's going on?
[name="Busy Cop"]Noemi, tell the workers to put out the fire, now!
[multiline(name="Noemi")]I'm on it!
[multiline(name="Noemi",end=true)]Wait. Look at that float. Doesn't it look like it's been in an accident?
[name="Noemi"]You mean, this is the truck we've been looking for, the one that hit the Acting Mayor?
[name="Busy Cop"]That fire is getting out of control. If we wait for them to put it out, there'll be nothing left.
[name="Noemi"]You think this fire was accidental?
[name="Noemi"]I just think... hiding the truck among the parade floats, then setting it on fire, all just to destroy the evidence? That's both too complicated and blatant.
[name="Busy Cop"]Or maybe... that's what they want.
[name="Busy Cop"]It's a message, a provocation.
The fire completely engulfs the float, its flickering flames making it appear as though it were alive. The onlookers can almost hear the towering wolf, ablaze, roaring in the inferno.
A gust of wind blows through, carrying the thick smoke, which spreads like dark clouds, enveloping the entire city.
Suddenly, Noemi thinks to herself, 'maybe being a police officer is harder than it looks.'
