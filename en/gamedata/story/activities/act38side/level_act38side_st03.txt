[name="Gambino"]Hey, I don't got the acting experience. You're the one who's an extra in the mayor's promotional video.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_701_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="'Dispatcher'"]It ain't the same thing. I was just being myself in the promo, and we could always do another take. Screw up just now, and all of Antonio's plans would've been blown.
[name="'Dispatcher'"]This is an important night for you, for me, and for all of Venezia.
[name="'Dispatcher'"]Once this city is firmly under our control, Antonio will be as good as his word. He'll support you in... what's the wording? Restoring the glory of Sicilia?

[name="'Dispatcher'"]Don't worry.
[name="'Dispatcher'"]Every vehicle that goes in and out of the port has to go through special checks. Venezia Trucking's trucks have been added to the list.
[name="'Dispatcher'"]The nomadic city's positioning system has been turned off, with the exception of a single encrypted channel. Other than the famiglia's landship, no vehicles will approach the city tonight.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_542_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Gambino"]The rest of the boys are outside. Once the landship approaches the city and starts docking, everybody in Nuova Volsinii Port who ain't part of this is gonna disappear.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_701_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="'Dispatcher'"]What about Antonio?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_542_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Gambino"]You think the boss needs us to worry about him?
[name="Gambino"]A few hours left... enjoy the night, Nuova Volsinii. Enjoy the true Carnevale.

The voice came from above.
