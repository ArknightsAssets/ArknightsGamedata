[name="Truck Driver B"]Shame. Imagine staying by Talulah's side the entire time but never realizing your so-called leader was an evil dragon spewing lies... A lot of lives could've been saved.

[name="Lyudmila"]......
[name="Sommer"]Don't blame Romi and the others for pestering you with questions. They don't mean anything bad about it. They just want to get to know you a little better.
[name="Sommer"]Don't be a stranger, Lyudmila.
[name="Lyudmila"]......
The setting sun dyes the grass of the camp and the drivers' faces a deep red. Sommer leans against the back of his truck, stretching his hand out to her. The other drivers look at her, nary a hint of wariness on their smiling faces.
Can you get drunk off salt soda? The Reproba wonders as she furrows her brow.
After a short moment of silence, she lowers her mask and takes the proffered bottled of soda from him.

Once the convoy of trucks has left and night slowly washes over the camp, Sommer, all on his lonesome, goes to his own truck.
He starts the engine, but before he even closed the door, a figure was already sat in the passenger seat, seat belt fastened and all.
