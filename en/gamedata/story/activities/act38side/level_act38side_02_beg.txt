Eirene leaves the courthouse as if she's fleeing something.
She doesn't dare to look back on what just happened, what she experienced, or the struggles she went through.
A taxi stops right in front of her. She does not remember whether she hailed it or not.

The driver steps on the brake.
She doesn't know why, but Eirene has the feeling that, from the moment she got in the car, the driver has been waiting for this exact instruction. She even catches a glimpse of the driver's bright smile in the rearview mirror.
