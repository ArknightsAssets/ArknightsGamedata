It is a custom-built cargo landship.
A massive vehicle that travels from city to city, its enormous, resilient hull able to protect massive amounts of cargo from Catastrophes and hazardous terrain. It is not an object that one would expect to see inside a city.
But it has forced its way into Nuova Volsinii by brute force, its tracks crushing the ground underneath it, sending gravel flying. It tears buildings apart like paper as it brushes past them, and the resultant rubble falls from the sky like a rain of stone.

Beams from spotlights sweep away the darkness around her. The tactful night breeze brushes open the bright red on her shoulder.
The best tailor in Siracusa has weaved roses and blood into the dress of the White Wolf, equally at home on stage or in the wilds.
Seemingly satisfied at the reaction of the audience of mafioso and truck drivers, Lappland delivers her brightest smile, and takes a graceful bow.

[name="Texas"]There are almost a thousand truck drivers on this square.
[name="Texas"]The mafiosi are picking up the weapons, and these ordinary folk have to do the same in order to protect themselves—

[name="Lappland"]...
[name="Lappland"]Why did you decide to come down from the sky, Texas? Who blocked the courthouse doors?
[name="Lappland"]The mafiosi are not the only ones wearing masks on this square.

[name="Lappland"]Famiglia Venezia has been plotting to take over the city with these weapons. You needed to discover their plot. Those drivers needed to protect themselves...
[name="Lappland"]All I did was bring out into the open what everybody wanted.

[name="Lappland"]You know how much I hate chess players. I prefer to put my foot down on the chessboard.
[name="Lappland"]Tonight is Carnevale. It's a time to review the progress that this new city has made in the past year. Everyone has the right to express their views and their demands about it, don't they?
[name="Lappland"]Candy alone isn't enough to make everybody happy.
[name="Lappland"]Look over there...

[name="Texas"]Not interested.
[name="Lappland"]I'll take that as a yes.
[name="Texas"]...
[name="Lappland"]You were always more alert, more vigilant than anyone.
[name="Lappland"]You never claimed to have high and lofty ideals, but you have a funny way of ending up on whichever side stood for justice, whether in Yan or Siracusa.
[name="Lappland"]The time now is 11:30. The parade procession will arrive at Court Square in fifteen minutes.
[name="Lappland"]Who do you think will fire the first shot?
[name="Lappland"]Will hundreds of thousands of Nuova Volsinians see two groups lining the streets to welcome them in perfect peace and harmony...
[name="Lappland"]Or will they see the streets run red with blood, and bring this truly Siracusan festival to a climax?
[name="Lappland"]I've seen the weather forecast. Clear skies are expected tonight. There will be no rain to wash away the blood.
