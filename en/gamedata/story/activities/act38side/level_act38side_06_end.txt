In a corner of Nuova Volsinii's port, a dozen or so mobile cranes are hoisting up giant tarpaulins, creating a labyrinth out of thin air, sealed away from the outside.
Under the tarps, a dozen oddly-shaped giant beasts sleep silently. Ere their resurrection at Carvenale, this is their cemetery.
Lyudmila passes by them. She is not in the mood to investigate these strange constructs. She walks directly to the end of their procession and stops.
There lies a great wolf. Vast amounts of imitation fur cover the truck underneath its frame. Its tail oh-so-conveniently droops down over the eye-catching dents and gouges of the truck's carriage.
It bares its fangs in soundless snarl, guarding the secrets hidden below its body.
