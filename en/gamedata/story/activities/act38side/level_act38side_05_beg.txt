[charslot(slot = "l", name = "char_1502_crowns",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "char_1502_crowns",focus="l")]
[name="Lyudmila"]No, it's not. The stories inside aren't for entertainment, but to get people thinking.
[name="Lyudmila"]What is 'truth'? What is 'justice'?
[name="Lyudmila"]Should they be considered the same? Should they be set against each other? Who gets to be the one that defines them? Which side of the scale do we believe we're on?
[name="Lyudmila"]Or maybe they don't exist in any real sense? Just like... Just like how Reunion is over.

[name="Lyudmila"]I was just about to say. This is where we part, friend.
[name="Lyudmila"]If you keep going straight this way, you'll come out of the woods and spot some old nomadic city tracks.
[name="Lyudmila"]There's likely to be Leithanian border patrol teams nearby, or possibly Siracusan cargo landships passing through. Watch out for them.

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "char_1502_crowns",focus="l")]
[name="Lyudmila"]Look at this bonfire out here among the snow, friend. Once, it could ignite the anger of the Infected. It could spark the dream of Reunion. It could set all of Ursus ablaze.
[name="Lyudmila"]But now, all it does is keep us warm.
[name="Lyudmila"]Here's the last thing I have to say to you: Forget Talulah. Forget Chernobog. Forget Lungmen. Forget Reunion. Forget us. If you choose to leave, then leave it all behind you.
[name="Lyudmila"]Hell, forget the crystals growing on your body. Maybe if you forget everything, you can go home.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "char_1002_nsabr_2",focus="r")]

[name="Reunion Member"]Though we both chose to leave, I always felt you and I weren't alike...
[name="Reunion Member"]You look like you're the type of person who knows a lot, and you've read lots of books. At times, I feel like you, the Captain and Talulah are all pretty similar.

A wolf with gray hair, wearing a red hoodie.

Lyudmila silently looks at the fire in front of her. It is a burning duffel bag, her master interred within.
She did not sleep at all that night. She thinks about how she used salt and water to scrub away the bloodstains in the room, how she dragged her master's corpse out into the wilds under the cover of the incessant rain.
She was stick-thin before she died. Lyudmilla barely had to exert herself.
Lyudmila never forgot how she met her master.
There was blood everywhere. Her uncle, her only living relative. His family. His servants. Their corpses strewn across the entire house.
The one who sent her to Siracusa told her that her uncle had control of the businesses on a couple of streets. Not a powerful man, per se, but in a small Siracusan town, it would be enough to let her live comfortably.
But before she could even get used to her new life... A simple Originium bomb smashed through the windows. In the chaos, her arm was gashed. She trembled in fear as she cowered under the bed.
There was no difference between the gangsters rushing into that house and the Ursus Guard charging into the lab. She felt like she was back in Chernobog, back in that night she lost her father.
Only when everything finally went quiet did Lyudmila dare to leave her room.
The gangsters, too, were lying down in pools of blood. The only ones alive in the house were her and the lowliest of her uncle's servants.
If memory served correctly, the servant was always living out by the gate, in charge of sending and receiving letters. The only time she would limp into the house was to deliver the mail to her masters.
She would always tiptoe across the carpet, so as to not make too loud a noise.
