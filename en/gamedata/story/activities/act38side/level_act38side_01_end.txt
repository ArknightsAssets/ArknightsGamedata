[name="Texas"]I received your invitation.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]...
[name="Lavinia"]We never heard back from you. We assumed you weren't planning to return to Nuova Volsinii.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]I was busy.
[name="Texas"]Croissant is busy pushing Bison into organizing some new international project, Sora is only halfway through her tour of Siracusa, and Exusiai—who knows where she's run off to this time?
[name="Texas"]I've been managing Penguin Logistics myself this whole time, with far fewer staff and no fewer orders.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]Besides, these crowded celebrations really don't excite me. I prefer just stopping by when I'm on a delivery, assuming it's on the way.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]Then what brings you here today?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#9$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]What can I do? I have a boss who loves a good crowd. One night, he happened to spot that invitation and had me pack my bags on the spot.
[name="Texas"]He's very interested in the 'themed party' you're hosting. He cleared his calendar, shut down 'The Ends of the Earth' for two weeks, and dragged me here all the way from Lungmen.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#9$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]Relax, Lavinia. You seem so tense.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#6$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]Leon, he...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]I've been briefed on it.
[name="Texas"]It wasn't an accident?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]The police are still investigating. I just got back from the scene... I don't think it was an accident.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]Persons of interest?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#7$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]Yes.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]The usual suspects?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#7$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]Uhuh.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]Why?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]On the night of the Carnevale parade, Leon was supposed to officially announce his appointment as mayor of Nuova Volsinii at the front of the procession.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#8$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]It's not a strange decision, per se, but he did seem a bit too eager.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]Even if he abandoned his family, he is still Bernardo Bellone's son. One year is not enough for people to forget the turmoil Bernardo once stirred in Volsinii.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]Staying behind the scenes makes it easier for him to keep the government functioning. This is the safest approach. It's much better than him changing clothes, putting down his defensive staff, and stepping back into the spotlight.
[name="Texas"]Nuova Volsinii has only been around for a year and he's barely managing to hold onto his position as Acting Mayor, even with Signora Sicilia's backing.

[name="Texas"]Did they find new evidence?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]No, it's a message from the court. We have a case...
[dialog]
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#3$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]That's kind of tricky?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]Uhuh.
[name="Lavinia"]Honestly, I understand why Leon was in such a hurry.
[name="Lavinia"]This year, the changes in Nuova Volsinii can be seen with the naked eye. Many things that once existed only in our imagination have now become a reality.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#3$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]Isn't that what Signora Sicilia wanted?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]Well, but it's not enough; not nearly enough. We must show our presence to promote more changes.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]So I stopped trying to persuade him, but then...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#9$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]You're still the same as before—no, even more naive than back then. It's kind of nice.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]Texas, do you want to come with me?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#3$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]To the court?
[name="Texas"]You know I'm not interested in crowded celebrations, much less official duties involving mountains of paperwork.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#9$1", focus="r")]
[name="Texas"]I'm going to stay here and ensure Leon's safety. Right now, there's no one better suited to the job, right?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]Thank you, Texas.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lavinia"]To be honest, if you had stayed with me in Nuova Volsinii back then—
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#10$1", focus="r")]
[multiline(name="Texas")]I told you before, when my friends are in trouble, I'll come to help.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#9$1", focus="r")]
[multiline(name="Texas",end=true)]I'm here, aren't I?
