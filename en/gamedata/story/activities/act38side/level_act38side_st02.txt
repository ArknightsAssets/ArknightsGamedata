Luchino turns around, and does not see any mafioso come out from the residence.

Was he three, or four?
He remembers a vehicle driving by the farm. An old man jumps down, fails his landing, and falls clumsily.
The old man then walks up to him. He stares at the mud on his face, a pair of scissors, and a ruler on his waist, and bursts into tears from fear. The old man panics, frantically trying to soothe him—
There were far fewer wrinkles on his face then.
The old man takes him by the hand and leads him away from the farm. Uncertain of where they're going, he cries even louder in fear. The noise startles nearby fowlbeasts, sending them flying into the distance.
'Hush, Luchino. Don't cry.'
'Umberto, say something, anything... Ah, Nonno will tell you a tale...'
'Every hunter runs into a wolf before they go into the wastes.'
'The wolf says: Mulberry wood makes sturdy bows, and stones can be sharpened into deadly blades; but you must shed the clothes on you to survive, for it is the only thing that does not belong in the barrens...'

[name="Venezia Sr."]How is she doing on Rhodes Island?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4026_vulpis_1#2$1")]
[name="Ingrid"]She's considered an employee now. A few years ago, she even went to Leithanien and helped them investigate an incident about missing Infected.
[name="Ingrid"]She even kept it a secret from me and never mentioned it in her letters. I talked to her friends when I went to see her, and they were all saying how well she did on that mission.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#3$1")]
[name="Venezia Sr."]I miss Lisa so much.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4026_vulpis_1#2$1")]
[name="Ingrid"]If she's willing to come back, I won't stop her... You know I'm not here to reminisce about old times.
[name="Ingrid"]Perhaps you had many plans for me when you insisted I keep the famiglia emblem—

Ingrid glances at Antonio standing silently on the side.
[charslot]
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1544_1#7$1")]
[name="Antonio"]Keep it, Ingrid. Papa was telling me how we could all visit Montelupe together after Carnevale is over.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4026_vulpis_1#2$1")]
[name="Ingrid"]Hm?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#1$1")]
[name="Venezia Sr."]Anton, it's too early for that.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1544_1#7$1")]
[name="Antonio"]Didn't you say Signora Sicilia might relent?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#1$1")]
[name="Venezia Sr."]...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1544_1#8$1")]
[name="Antonio"]She used to loathe Carnevale, and now it's back in Siracusa with a brand new look. Compared to that, Ingrid's violations are not even worth mentioning.
[name="Antonio"]I mean, it's been six years. Famiglia Tancredi today is no longer worthy of Signora Sicilia's concern.
[name="Antonio"]In these six years, I used the single vehicle factory I held onto and ate up all of their businesses in Terni.
[name="Antonio"]Signora Sicilia values results. So I showed her.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#1$1")]
[name="Venezia Sr."]Is that how you see it, Anton?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1544_1#4$1")]
[name="Antonio"]Yes, papa.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4026_vulpis_1#2$1")]
[name="Ingrid"]Antonio's done very well by your side. The family no longer needs me here.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#1$1")]
[name="Venezia Sr."]Anton... After Bella's passing, I could feel him becoming wary of me.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1544_1#2$1")]
[name="Antonio"]...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#1$1")]
[name="Venezia Sr."]How much value did he have as a son-in-law after Bellas's death? That's probably what he was thinking at the time, and how he got himself so busy after.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1544_1#6$1")]
[name="Antonio"]Papa, I—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#1$1")]
[name="Venezia Sr."]I don't want to give you too much pressure. We already have enough territory, even in this newly-built Nuova Volsinii.
[name="Venezia Sr."]You've done very well, Anton.
[name="Venezia Sr."]Seeing Ingrid leave and Bella die... what I truly care about is the few 'family' I have left... After all, I am an old man.
[name="Venezia Sr."]I don't want to lose any of you anymore.

[name="Venezia Sr."]Ingrid?
[name="Ingrid"]There's never been much I could do for you, besides killing.
[name="Ingrid"]But even the best killer is still just a killer, not 'Venezia Junior'. Antonio fits that role better than I can, so my departure isn't such a big loss.
[name="Ingrid"]You must have realized it in the past six years. Deep inside you're disappointed with me.
[name="Venezia Sr."]...
[name="Ingrid"]But wasn't I disappointed too, when I failed to find out the truth about her injury?
[name="Ingrid"]Oripathy is incurable. You know better than anyone else why I came back to Siracusa.
[name="Ingrid"]I intend to find the culprit I couldn't track down six years ago... and end his life. That's the only thing I want to do.
[name="Venezia Sr."]But you know what it means to abandon the emblem and leave.
[name="Ingrid"]Yes. We might end up as oppositions.
[name="Venezia Sr."]...
[name="Ingrid"]I can't guarantee that I won't harm any of the Venezias.
[name="Ingrid"]Even so, I'll make things decent, for your sake. This is the only thing I can promise you.

The old man runs his fingers over the famiglia crest, and puts it in his chest pocket.

[name="Venezia Sr."]We all know what kind of person she is.
[name="Venezia Sr."]She's not easily swayed when she's set on something. I'll keep this emblem for now. When she comes to her senses, I'll return it to her.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#1$1")]

[name="Antonio"]Yes, papa.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1544_1#4$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1545_1#1$1")]
[name="Venezia Sr."]Is that so? Anton, there are some matters you can judge on your own to be right or wrong...
[name="Venezia Sr."]But when it involves the famiglia's reputation, think carefully before you act.
