[name="Police Officer"]Ingrid has more than twenty criminal records spread out between five nomadic city courts, each one corresponding to a spike in the Venezias' influence in the area...
[name="Police Officer"]The famiglia has also always tried their best to keep her away from any revenge killings or court trials.
[name="Police Officer"]Rumor has it that Venezia senior even favored her more than his actual daughter.

[name="Police Officer"]More accurately, she defected.
[name="Police Officer"]Venezia Trucking expanded their business to Terni then. Famiglia Tancredi was actively provoking the other side so they could plunder the local alloy deposits. The conflict intensified and eventually escalated into a gang war.
[name="Police Officer"]The two Grey Hall famiglie were practically locked in a cycle of violence, and they even tried to put a hit out on Venezia senior...
[name="Police Officer"]Ingrid went into a killing spree, taking down more than ten of the Tancredis' made men.
[name="Police Officer"]Strange thing is, when Signora Sicilia personally came down and the two famiglie finally managed to start negotiations... Ingrid ignored the don's order to stop and continued her slaughter.
[name="Police Officer"]I saw the records. The stuff she did... freaks me out even now.

[name="Police Officer"]Unclear.
[name="Police Officer"]Anyway, Ingrid basically challenged Signora Sicilia's authority with her actions, but vanished without a trace after that...
