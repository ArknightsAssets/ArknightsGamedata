[name="High Priest"]No need to get excited, Dolly. The musician isn't wrong; that's what Siracusan legends say about sheep.

[name="Dolly"]Look, I just like getting chased by wolves. Playing hide-and-seek with them was one of the few hobbies I had during my time in Siracusa.

[name="Dolly"]Stop throwing cold water on our fun.
[name="Dolly"]How do the Siracusans see YOU, Emperor?
[name="Emperor"]Tell 'im about the black-robed singer, Big Mouth!
[name="High Priest"]Well... once upon a time, there was a mafia Don who loathed music and banned it in his city, until a penguin singer dressed in a black robe arrived many years later.
[name="High Priest"]When he started singing at the town square, the citizens, having no concept of music, found it too noisy and tried to catch the singer and hand him over to the Don.
[name="High Priest"]But the singer was too quick and slippery, even for the most athletic young man.
[name="High Priest"]He continued to sing as more and more people joined the chase, which eventually turned into a great dance that engulfed the entire city.
[name="High Priest"]The singer sang for three days and three nights until the furious Don had enough and came to catch him personally. But the Don was caught in the revelry as soon as he walked out of the door, and was never seen again.
[name="Dolly"]Why does Emperor get to sound like a brave, clever hero when he's not half as wise as I am?
[name="Emperor"]It ain't about wisdom, it's about Graf Pangwen's attitude toward music! Freedom n' struggle! You never did listen to the albums I signed for you, did you?

The crowd passes by three Aristocrats of Beasts, as Dolly's clones meander through the sea of people. All can see them; no one shows any surprise.
In this ocean of revelry, not a single sea spray feels out of place.
A dozen massive floats form an orderly row, carrying the visages of wolf, sheep, penguin, cat, dog... legendary beasts that have come together in this city to lead the procession.
The streets are brimming—nay, overflowing—with plays and improvised performances. Musicians and acrobats seem locked in a competition to outdo one another, forcing food cart owners to raise their voices even higher to peddle beer, pizza and ice cream.
[name="Dolly"]This is even more exciting than an active volcano.
[name="High Priest"]Better than the old Carnevale. Even fatso didn't enjoy that kind of party.
[name="Emperor"]Please don't dirty the word 'party' by usin' it on a mafia-masked murder-fest.
[name="Emperor"]One tree don't bear two fruits. The Siracusans are just like those wolves.
[name="Emperor"]Thousands of years ago, we left the wolves out of our parties because those dumbass pups didn't know nothin' but fighting and killing. So they came up with their own game.
[name="Emperor"]Lucky the Siracusans are smarter, and they decided there's things worth celebrating besides than killing and fighting for territory.
[name="Emperor"]As for the wolves that don't know how to change—
[name="High Priest"]They sense the same thing that we do. They know something is not right.
[name="High Priest"]We're 'kindred', after all. There are certain things that we need to talk about.
[name="High Priest"]I've met the ones that are less stupid, but they won't listen to anyone until their stupid game is done.
[name="Emperor"]Well, they got a sayin' in Yan, and it means basically 'When in Londinium, do as the Londiniers do.'
[name="Emperor"]Now, if this is a party, the Siracusans better not let me down!
