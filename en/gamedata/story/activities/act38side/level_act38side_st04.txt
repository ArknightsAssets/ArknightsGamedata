[charslot]
As the Carnevale drew to a close and the dust settled in the square last night, Lyudmila spotted a familiar red silhouette.
She followed the figure through winding alleys—sometimes hitting dead ends, other times standing still. It clearly had no direction.
Lyudmila readied for an ambush, biding her time. Her strike landed true.
She pinned the figure down, pressing her blade against its heart. Just a little more, and she would avenge her mentor and end this haunting ghost.
But the red Lupo offered no resistance. She simply knelt, muttering as she stared into space.
Lyudmila looked into her eyes and saw nothing but emptiness. The silence was brief, and the red lupo spoke—

[name="Lappland"]Whether one pursues it, detests it, seeks to control it, or grasps it like a drowning man clutching at straws...

[name="Zaaro"]That depends on what Vargo, Agnese, and the ones over there who haven't spoken think.
[name="Agnese"]No human has ever been the alpha of the pack in the memory of the Signori dei Lupi... nay, of the Beast Aristocrats.
[name="Lappland"]Do you have a hierarchy over here?

[name="Vargo"]...There's one more thing you forgot.
[name="Vargo"]Look at the crystals on her leg. She's pretty far gone, and Oripathy is an uncurable disease for humans. Will we, deathless Signori dei Lupi, recognize a dying human as alpha?
[name="Lappland"]True, I probably don't have much time left.
[name="Lappland"]Doesn't that add to the thrill of the game?

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_692_1#4$1", focus="l")]
[name="Agenir"]Well, I didn't tell you. Or anyone else, for that matter.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1541_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]Are you planning to leave now?
[name="Leontuzzo"]I'll go back to Montelupe with you. There are certain things that I should explain to Signora Sicilia personally.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_692_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Agenir"]Why?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1541_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]Huh?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_692_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Agenir"]This city is just entering its second year. Its mayor has many things to attend to.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_692_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Agenir"]Take it easy, young man.
[name="Agenir"]I'm loath to admit that we're like concerned parents who quietly follow their children the first time they go out on their own...
[name="Agenir"]But yes, I came to this city at Sicilia's behest.. to see it, deal with some people or declare a decree on her behalf, if it comes to that.
[name="Agenir"]But I did nothing. The Carnevale had its little hiccups, but it's come to a satisfactory conclusion, hasn't it?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1541_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]...

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1541_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]I can't deny it.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_692_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Agenir"]Well, Sicilia had so much more on her plate when she first came back to Siracusa. It wasn't easy, bringing guns and order to this country.
[name="Agenir"]Of course, you're facing more resistance than she did. That's why she wouldn't pour cold water on the fire of youth... she hasn't gotten that old.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1541_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]...
[name="Leontuzzo"]I'm not coming back with you to Montelupe to prostrate myself before Signora Sicilia and beg for her mercy.
[name="Leontuzzo"]I have some plans about the future of Nuova Volsinii, about promoting the New Urban Management Act...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_692_1#1$1", focus="l")]
