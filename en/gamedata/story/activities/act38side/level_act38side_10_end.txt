Antonio thinks back to the circles that the noble drunkenly drew on the list, and his severed head when the guerillas cut it off.
He thinks back to Ingrid, Venezia Senior, Leontuzzo, Alberto, Signora Sicilia... all the people he hates.

Carle stares blankly at the lifeless body on the ground. He has never seen such fury as that which is on Antonio's face, even unto death.

[name="Leontuzzo"]That's what we have been trying to achieve over the past year.
[name="Leontuzzo"]There is no famiglia in Nuova Volsinii. The reforms associated with this saying doesn't rely on 'Siracusan' methods, as Siracusans know it—
[name="Leontuzzo"]A secret negotiation, an assasination in the dark, a purge of the city, a deadly struggle between famiglie...
[name="Leontuzzo"]All that has happened here, and all that will happen, will be viewed through the lens of the law.
[name="Leontuzzo"]We're giving a new order to our new life. The swamp that Siracusans used to take for granted will no longer faze us.
[name="Leontuzzo"]A friend once said to me that I'm walking down a thorny path.
[name="Leontuzzo"]He's right. But all the challenges that we have faced is exactly why Nuova Volsinii must continue to move forward.
[name="Leontuzzo"]For everyone who has been hurt on this path, for everyone who may be hurt in the future, I'm sorry.
[name="Leontuzzo"]But at the same time, I continue to extend an invitation to all the friends who have something to ask of Nuova Volsinii.
[name="Leontuzzo"]We shall trample the thorns together and make this brand-new, one-of-a-kind city better, little by little, until it's ready to usher in a new era.
[name="Leontuzzo"]As a matter of fact, a new era for Siracusa has already begun, a future filled with infinite possibilities.

Demetri gazes forward silently, at the silhouette of Leontuzzo outlined by the countless lights.

[name="Demetri"]Saluzzo's wine isn't bad, but I prefer my own.

[name="Demetri"]I promise that to you.

Demetri turns around.
The mayor's speech continues, but he has received the answer he was looking for. Demetri has accepted the invitation, or perhaps, the declaration of a very long war.
