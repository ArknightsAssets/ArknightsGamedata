[name="Narantuya"]Haha.
[name="Narantuya"]You know what? Somebody told me ten minutes ago that the locals are never troubled because money can always solve their problems.
[name="Narantuya"]I thought that made sense. What's there to be sad about, if you're not as desitute as me?

[name="Lost Passerby?"]Today, someone threw something at me, another soiled the new cape I got last week, and I was inexplicably married twenty times to people of all genders and ages.
[name="Lost Passerby?"]No one was interested in listening to me either.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#4$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]O-Oh... that's pretty unlucky.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#2$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]How old are you? They stole your identity for a marriage registration?
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
[name="Lost Passerby?"]...What?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#1$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]Your voice is a little strange, but you sound young. No offense.
[name="Narantuya"]*sigh* I think I was pretty lucky, when I was around your age.
[name="Narantuya"]One time, we were herding some stolen burdenbeasts back home, and the sky suddenly turned dark. Our headscarves couldn't shield us from the sand flying our way.
[name="Narantuya"]But we had plenty of manpower, and quickly found a somewhat different area to dig into.
[name="Narantuya"]Guess what we found? Two houses buried in the sand, just enough to fit everyone. Even came with beds and tables.
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
[name="Lost Passerby?"]...Common furnishing you find in ancient tombs.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#6$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]Hahaha! You know your stuff! I only found out a few years later.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#1$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]Those were wonderful days.
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
[name="Lost Passerby?"]Indeed... Time can alter how rivers flow, establish and eradicate cities, bleach bones with the sun, elongate and intensify history.
[name="Lost Passerby?"]It makes one miss the past, and nostalgia... can be a fearsome thing.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#11$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]Yeah. Miss the past all you want, but you're never getting it back.
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
[name="Lost Passerby?"]...
[name="Lost Passerby?"]How are the people you've been missing?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#2$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]They're alive, but more surviving than living.
[name="Narantuya"]The worst part is that they can't just move on. You have no idea how many of them sold off their blades.
[name="Narantuya"]So as their boss, I owe them.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#6$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]I mean, I just need to build a new pile of gold, and those stooges will cheer up and return to the way they used to be.
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
[name="Lost Passerby?"]I hope that is the case.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#1$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]What about you?
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
[name="Lost Passerby?"]I... don't know either.
[name="Lost Passerby?"]It's like how people risk their lives to catch a glimpse of the river god, but all they end up seeing is the last face they would ever want to see. Is that not a terrifying prospect?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#1$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]It's not <i>that</i> scary, if people still choose to chase that mirage.
[name="Narantuya"]Well, that's what my mother always told me, back home:
[name="Narantuya"]'We Nightzmora must be the masters of fear, and will never be dominated by it.' That's what they all say.
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
[name="Lost Passerby?"]â€”You're a Nightzmora?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4138_narant_1#1$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]Yeah, whyâ€”

Narantuya feels a pat on her shoulder and turns her head on reflex.
She sees no one but the silent street, with its lamps being lit one by one from a distance.
The lamplighter hums a tune as he walks up to them, climbing up a ladder and opening the glass shade to light it.
