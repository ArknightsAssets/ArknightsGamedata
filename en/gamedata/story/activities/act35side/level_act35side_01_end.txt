A heavy exhibition hall door is pushed open, then closed again.
No one remembers that it should be open, no one cares that it was opened, and no one has cleaned the dusty sign that reads 'Northeastern Tributary Exhibit' in ages.
The hall is silent.
Aspasia's heart thumps against her chest, almost loud enough to drown out her whispering footsteps.
She passes by the black monuments of lost tribes and colorful Kjerag rugs, casting her gaze towards the dark depths of the hall.

[name="Aspasia"]But—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1477_1#6$1")]
[name="Aspasia"]It's all wrong!
[name="Aspasia"]I recognize you, the golden goblet that once sat in the center of the temple. My grandfather came to visit you, many years ago, as did my mother after him.
[name="Aspasia"]Much has my family suffered for your loss.
[name="Aspasia"]Why has this museum put it among the clay bowls for fermented milk? They share no common material or style!
[name="Aspasia"]And where is the other half of the pair? The Sargonians took them all, yet they do not keep them safe!
[name="Aspasia"]Even the exhibit description is—

She takes a long look at the exhibit label, then pulls the metal plate off the wall and looks to the other side.
Both sides are perfectly smooth, with only her own reflection upon them.
