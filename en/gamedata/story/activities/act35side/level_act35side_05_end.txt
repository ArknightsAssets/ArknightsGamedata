[name="Narantuya"]Yeah? It's not <i>that</i> important.
[name="Narantuya"]I might have a few drops of Nightzmoran blood in me, but they didn't turn me into a tyrant or a conqueror, and I have no intention of letting them influence my life either.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1479_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[name="Narantuya"]So yeah, what about you?
[name="Narantuya"]I've heard that in the Shah's time, people would shave their heads bald when they came of age, that they applied perfumed ointment to their scalps. But some say the scent smelled more like a stench... so I'm pretty curious if that's true.
