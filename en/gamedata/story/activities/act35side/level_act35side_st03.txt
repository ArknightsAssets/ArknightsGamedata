[name="Mio"]...Are you still staying here, then?
[name="Mio"]Zubayr has found his final rest. The descendant of the Shah has learned the truth of the trove, those whispers that echo through time.
[name="Mio"]And you took the Nightzmora to see the treasure, didn't you?

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1482_1#4$1")]
[name="Mio"]True. It's as if the entire city has its tongue cut out by the Shahanshah. I don't like it.
[name="Mio"]But unlike you, I'm going to see it for myself.
