[name="Jewel Construct"]He who led the outlanders to stride upon the earth, forsaking their ships from this domain. His legions, brandishing golden blades, shielded the reckless and inquisitive travelers.

[name="Anat"]You ask of sandbeast. There was a trend in sixth-century Sargon to hunt sandbeasts.
[name="Anat"]The museum used to have strings of sandbeast heads hung up to ward off evil, though we always saw it as a needless worship of nature.
[name="Anat"]But... since you've witnessed that history. You should know that the real reason for hunting sandbeasts was that a small number of them mutated from high concentration of local active Originium, right?

The constructs' riddles are solved as the pages turn, and they gradually settle down.
They stop in a circle around Anat, like a group of silent listeners.
Anat recalls the moment right before she gave her first speech. Titi taught her to imagine the audience as museum artifacts to calm her nerves.
'Just keep talking about the things you know are true, Anat.'

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4139_papyrs_1#3$2", focus="l")]
[name="Anat"]No. I used to not get it.
[name="Anat"]Sargon's written history dates back to when other nations were still in their primitive states. When you left Sargon to explore these lands, I wondered what more you hoped to learn.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4139_papyrs_1#7$2", focus="l")]
[name="Anat"]That's why I chose to read <i>Terra: A Journey.</i>
[name="Anat"]I saw within our limited time on this land that we hold too many misunderstandings and prejudices.

[name="Anat"]...
[name="Anat"]Actually, I've been thinking... if these constructs are using history riddles to verify if we are worthy of controlling them...
[name="Anat"]Then what was the word that activated this verification mode of theirs?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4139_papyrs_1#9$2", focus="l")]
[name="Anat"]And what exactly was their creator thinking when they chose this command word—'Horakhet'?

Pepe turns her head and sees a girl holding a white lotus, with a similar golden lotus on her forehead, sparkling in the sun.
