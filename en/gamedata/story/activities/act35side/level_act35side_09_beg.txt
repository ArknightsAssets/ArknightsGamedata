The oil lamps on the wall light up, illuminating the hall with rays that meander through the mirror-smooth walls and pillars.
Countless ghostly shadows appear in an orderly procession in the hall.
[name="Pepe"]So the treasure in the Shah's trove was... himself?
[name="Pepe"]Was he a narcissist?
[name="Zubayr"]Of course not. My sister missed Father after he was gone, and she had me preserve his visage here.
[name="Zubayr"]A thousand years ago, historians preserved the words and deeds of my father using ancient technology they discovered, allowing him to appear, in a way.
[name="Pepe"]I found something similar in Arsalan. It showed me an image of the Shah in a crystal cave.
[name="Zubayr"]I left it as such. I thought a descendant of Nightzmora would find it and follow the trail.
[name="Pepe"]You hid it too well, Zubayr. No one else could have found it.
[name="Zubayr"]I hid it? I built a massive temple on top of it.
[name="Pepe"]I guess it didn't stand the test of time. All I found were some ruins.
[name="Zubayr"]But it guided you here, where you awakened me.
[name="Zubayr"]That is the wonder of time. What seemed trivial at the time could, by fate and coincidence, cause the puzzle piece to fall perfectly into place.
[name="Pepe"]There are even images of the Shah without his mask...
[name="Pepe"]Arsalan wasn't the only site I've seen images like these. When I was little, while playing hide-and-seek, my brother and I stumbled upon a chamber where the dead lay in their sarcophagi.
[name="Pepe"]I knew I would have to come into contact with these things eventually, but it was too much for a child of my age.
[name="Pepe"]In my panic, I accidentally activated a mechanism and an image of the Shah appeared. At the time, I didn't know who he was—just some ghost trying to communicate with me.
[name="Pepe"]He told me those sarcophagi were history buried in the sand.
[name="Pepe"]When those from the future dig them up, they will serve as a bridge across the vastness of time, bringing history and the present together over the great river of time.
[name="Zubayr"]I remember the saying... it's what Father said to comfort my sister when our mother passed away.
[name="Zubayr"]I remember what he said to my sister, after she became Historian. You must not...
[name="Pepe"]You must not let escape what made those heroes heroes so—each history has its reverse face.
[name="Zubayr"]So you've heard it.
[name="Pepe"]It was the last thing the image said. I've never forgotten.

Looking upon the image of Lugalszargus, Pepe cannot help but feel a sense of absurdity.
She had spent so much time wondering what the Shah's treasure trove held.
Now, though, she realizes she has been chasing shadow after shadow.
She holds her hammer tight, fighting back the urge to swing it and drive away the visages.
But what she fears more is the notion that perhaps her family's duty and legacy are nothing more than shadows too.

Pitch-black darkness indicates that they are staring at the interior of a massive structure.
There is no path in front of them. The sound of quicksand is clearly audible from deeper in, as though there is a raging river deep in the abyss.
A river from which there is no return.

[name="Zubayr"]You hold this impression because you have only lived twenty-two years.
[name="Zubayr"]I had cut down countless foes with my sword when I fought under my father's banner.
[name="Zubayr"]Their screams filled me with confidence. I believed that there was nothing I couldn't acquire, nothing I couldn't do, given enough time.
[name="Zubayr"]Little did I know, that my greatest enemy... was time itself!
