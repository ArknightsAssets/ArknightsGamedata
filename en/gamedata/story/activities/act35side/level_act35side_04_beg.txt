[name="Nervous Ceremony Judge"]Not only that, but it comes from an illustrious family of imperial historians.
[name="Nervous Ceremony Judge"]It would be difficult to find a slipper so well-preserved in the marketplace, and it's a submission rather uncharacteristic of a family of historians, at that—
[name="Nervous Ceremony Judge"]For past ceremonies, such families would usually submit letters, manuscripts, and other pieces of writing.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1494_1#1$1")]

[name="Ceremony Host"]Very well. Next, we have the last, but certainly not the least, entry into our competition...
[name="Ceremony Host"]A foreign treasure, a set of silver medals from Minos. We invite our expert to give an assessment.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1495_1#1$1")]
[name="Meticulous Ceremony Judge"]We are all aware that places far from Sargon also possess their own brilliant civilizations. The art and culture of Minos has proven to be harmonious with Sargonian social mores.
[name="Meticulous Ceremony Judge"]This set of medals embodies not only the Minoan love of sports, but more importantly, unlike most of the other entries, its year of manufacture can be determined with precision.
[name="Meticulous Ceremony Judge"]Indeed, our lives are well-adorned with gold, but products fashioned from silver are a rarity.
[name="Meticulous Ceremony Judge"]In fact, some historical periods saw silver considered the more precious metal.
[charslot]
[name="Ceremony Host"]What a fascinating analysis! Well then, which three contestants will win the opportunity to represent the city in offering these treasures to the river? Do allow me to announce this particular treasure's score...

[name="Ceremony Host"]This level of fierce competition is unprecedented! Your final position is third place, Aspasia Hanim. Though I regret you did not place higher, you have still secured the chance to perform the offering.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1477_1#1$1")]
[name="Aspasia"]I thank you. This was precisely the approval I sought.
[name="Aspasia"]However, if you so permit, I would protest your arrangement of these prizes after we conclude. I believe a golden Minoan goblet should rank higher than a third place prize.

[name="Rashad"]*sigh* It's a pity this ancient clay pot I brought shattered to pieces. I assume that offering pottery chips would be an affront to the river god?

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1491_1#1$1")]

[name="Rashad"]Resplendent Hatshepsut Hanim, daughter of the Padishah, you hold the highest title among all attendees. To bestow first place upon you is only fitting.
[name="Rashad"]And so I voluntarily renounce my position and withdraw from the competition.
