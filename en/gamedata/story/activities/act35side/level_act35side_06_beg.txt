[name="Lazvar"]A gemwright who had already lost his hands could no longer bear to see more of his kin suffer, so he approached the army and proposed to lead the way.
[name="Lazvar"]Before the trove, he watched the terrible battle between the army and its guardian unfold. He saw that though the guardian was defeated, the gates would not open without his Arts.
[name="Lazvar"]The furious army cut open the guardian's chest, plundering every gem inlaid within and without his body.
[name="Lazvar"]Although the gemwright used every technique he knew to guide his young child in restoring the guardian, he never woke up.
[name="Lazvar"]After that, a set of scales was set up in the Grand Bazaar of Menat-Ha'mait. Once an adult, the gemwright's child buried the guardian, then established a trading post specializing in gems.
[name="Lazvar"]His descendants have been waiting there ever since.
[name="Lazvar"]Every generation did all they could to ensure Menat-Ha'mait's gem trade would become even more prosperous.
