[name="Pepe"]Well...
[name="Pepe"]I AM curious. I figured it was some kind of Sarkaz witchcraft related to the Zhayedan.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1479_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Zubayr"]People in my time believed that life consists of three parts: Body, Name, and Soul.
[name="Zubayr"]Body is the physical vessel, and Name is the identity known to others. The Soul, however, is what truly makes us human; it is the emotions and experiences that form our character.
[name="Zubayr"]All three parts must be preserved together, in order for life to be eternal.
[name="Zubayr"]The Body can be replaced with something more durable. The Name can retain its meaning by being passed on through generations.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4058_pepe_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Pepe"]I know. That's the genesis of Sargonian noble heritage.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1479_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Zubayr"]The Soul, however, is the frailest of the three.
[name="Zubayr"]During the Age of Shadow, it was discovered that part of the Soul can be preserved, in a manner of speaking, by etching it upon a pure gem with Originium circuits.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4058_pepe_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Pepe"]Like the gem in your chest...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1479_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Zubayr"]Yes.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4058_pepe_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Pepe"]I've only ever read about it in ancient texts... Scholars call it superstition, borne out of a lack of understanding of the nature of life.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1479_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Zubayr"]That is a misinterpretation.
[name="Zubayr"]However, the true mystery, the method by which a life's journey is engraved, has long since been lost to time.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4058_pepe_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Pepe"]Or, it might exist, to some degree... gems with engraved Originium circuits can still be found in this city.
[name="Pepe"]Last year, a gem with Originium circuits that could change the ambient temperature in a small area was sold at auction for an incredible price.
