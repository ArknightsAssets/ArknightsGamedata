[name="Narantuya"]Huh? What metal constructs?
[name="Narantuya"]Lay it out for me slowly. I might have slept too soundly last night and missed some headlines.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1484_1#10$2")]
[name="Ajazi"]I thought you were the sharp one, Narantuya. How could you have missed it? There are weird metal constructs all over the street. Didn't they come at you?
[name="Ajazi"]They're tearing houses apart, making walls and pillars out of sand... and grabbing gems. Maybe you should check?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1484_1#2$2")]
[name="Ajazi"]Everyone lost something last night, from onyx necklaces on their necks to astrolabes that simulate the moons and stars.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4138_narant_1#4$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1485_1#8$2")]
[name="Ajani"]But where do we go?
[name="Ajani"]Everyone else can hide in their homes or at least stay in hotels behind locked doors. Are... we going back to the sewers?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1484_1#1$2")]
[name="Ajazi"]No problem, I know the way. I'll help us find our sleeping bags.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4138_narant_1#2$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]No... we're going back to the museum.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1485_1#3$2")]
[name="Ajani"]The museum? How could that place be safe when they'll hire people like me and Ajazi?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4138_narant_1#1$1")]
[name="Narantuya"]Think about it. Who are the experts on caravan routes, desert terrain, dune movement, burdenbeast habits, and tribal faiths? Bandits, meaning us.
[name="Narantuya"]So, who are the experts on the dead coming back to life, ancient curses, and necromancy? The museum folks.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1485_1#6$2")]
[name="Ajani"]...Makes sense.
