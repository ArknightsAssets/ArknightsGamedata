[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1479_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4058_pepe_1#8$3")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1479_1#2$1")]
[name="Zubayr"]When he left us, I had his cenotaph built in the deepest reach of his trove, so that it may also serve as his tomb.
[name="Zubayr"]For centuries they kept digging underground, and every artifact or treasure they found in the mausoleum became fuel for the city.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1479_1#4$1")]
[name="Zubayr"]This is my fault, but it is not too late. There is still a chance to stop it, as they have yet to dig into its depths... for the treasure that mustn't be touched by the wrong hands.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4058_pepe_1#8$3")]
[name="Pepe"]What is that exactly?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1479_1#4$1")]

A beam of sunlight pierces through the window, illuminating the floor beside Zubayr's feet.

He raises his staff high, and suddenly a strong wind stirs from nowhere. The sistrum chimes as it jingles.
Pepe hears Zubayr hum a tune that feels familiar, though its cryptic lyrics elude her understanding.

She then feels the ground beneath her feet soften, her ankles sinking into a flowing sea of sand.
As Zubayr finishes his tune, he plunges the staff into the ground.
[PlaySound(key="$d_avg_snowstormflp", volume=1, loop=true, channel="sn")]
In an instant, sand and dust swirl wildly, enveloping them both until they vanish.
