[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]Generally speaking, in that situation you should go to the Institute of Development Planning for an assessment.

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]You're a highly experienced and respected scholar, after all, and many in the city call you Magister.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]Magister? My last work was 'The Death of Life,' a book with no educational value whatsoever.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]I-I read it, actually. Although I couldn't understand much, with so many cryptic words. Like starship, stargate... it seemed like from another world.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]'Another world.' Hah, you're right about that.
[name="Avitus"]But I find myself undeserving of the title Magister. Often times I find myself lost in confusion.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]Jordi, do you remember when I told you that blood ties were unimportant?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]I do, but I already...
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]I may have been a bit misleading. While we indeed care little for blood relations, 'relationships' themselves are an excellent lead to follow.
[name="Avitus"]When one is lost, one ought to find a connection to reality—be it a life or an ideal—and seek a way out.
[name="Avitus"]Otherwise you'll end up like me, sinking into an extended questioning of the value of your own existence.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]If I may be so bold, can I ask whatyour own 'relationship' is...?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]My Familiar.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]How, exactly...?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]She shared the same thoughts and goals, and would enrich both my spirit and my ideas. I loved her as ardently as I loved Ægir, as well as everything we've done for it.
[name="Avitus"]I live a life surrounded by mountains of prehistoric material written in their strange script and incomprehensible grammar... I enjoy the process of translating it into Ægirian text.
[name="Avitus"]That was how we met, and I still remember how she'd throw herself into her work... Her eyebrows seemed to dance whenever she talked about something of interest to her.
[name="Avitus"]And when I told her so, in those exact words, she actually went to the Institute of Physical Art to find out if eyebrows could dance for real.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]What a strange form of art... Did they manage it?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]Strictly speaking, no. But some of their researchers were inspired to later develop the technology to make hair dance on its own.
[name="Avitus"]We've experienced the catastrophe that silenced the entire sea, and the Seaborn continue to threaten our existence, but we remain committed to exploring science, art, and our vision for the future.
[name="Avitus"]Lava bridges that pump power from the planet's mantle, aquatic artery hubs that transform currents into fountains, artificial suns illuminating the depths of the oceanic abyss, and ecological bases filling the barren seafloor with life...
[name="Avitus"]We persist in transforming what the Predecessors lost into mystical megastructures. We need only a spark to spur on countless inventions.
[name="Avitus"]One hundred fifty years is truly too short.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]One hundred and fifty years?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]Yes, the average lifespan of an Ægir.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]'Short,' you say...
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]The more dangerous the era, the more valuable our creations become.
[name="Avitus"]We firmly believed in living fulfilling lives, and would gladly have gone to our end without regrets as we passed down the fire of civilization.
[name="Avitus"]We planned an educational system we believed was better than the Institute of Incubation.
[name="Avitus"]Once our child was born via the incubator, we would raise them ourselves. They would possess a surging spirit and fresh ideologies, and become part of a more creative generation.
[name="Avitus"]It is unusual to raise children personally, but we had hoped to pass on the values we treasured from the fulfilling lives we'd lived.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]So, what happened to her?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]Dead.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]......
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]Remember the Predecessor mentioned in 'The Death of Life'?
[name="Avitus"]He took shelter in an unknown refuge as he watched the sky pressing down on the earth every day. He already had a premonition of his own end.
[name="Avitus"]There was nothing he could do but calmly welcome its advent.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]But that's someone else's life, a life far too distant from ours.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]Is it, though? Are we not currently going through the same things?
[name="Avitus"]Give it fifty years, maybe a hundred, and even the vast ocean may no longer hold a single drop of pure water.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Jordi"]......
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Avitus"]The Seaborn have unwittingly overrun the ocean faster than we can create, devouring what we were once proud of, turning 'survival' into our only priority.
[name="Avitus"]I watched as she was engulfed by despair. One day, she calmly gave up on our idea of raising our child ourselves.
[name="Avitus"]After all, everything we have inherited would only be lost in an era predestined to perish.
[name="Avitus"]Five years ago, the Abyssal Hunters went to the lair of the Firstborn, and no one returned alive.
[name="Avitus"]Soon after, she got sick, and died in depression. Our son was successfully born in the incubator, but I sent him to the Institute of Incubation.
[name="Avitus"]This was also when I began questioning the meaning of my own existence.

[name="Secunda"]I'm not joking around, Advisor Blandus.
[name="Secunda"]The data scientist's case has been confirmed to be a murder by the cultists, and it may be related to the assault on the lab.
[name="Secunda"]Ulpianus seemed to know the victim well, and openly expressed his distrust of Ægir.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#8$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4137_udflow_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Secunda"]...Why?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Blandus"]I saw your documents from the Institute of Development Planning. You'd written 'genetic research' in the box asking for your aspirations.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4137_udflow_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Secunda"]You only had to look at another file to see that becoming a Hunter was one another of my aspirations.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Blandus"]We considered you extremely talented, even among the participants of the Abyssal Hunter project.
[name="Blandus"]During our technical discussions, you were the only one to ask Ulpianus ten questions in a row and get answers for all of them. The highest record for a freshman researcher.
[name="Blandus"]The early transformation techniques were dangerous and unreliable. We were always searching for a better integration method. It was ultimately your theories that advanced the program's technology.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4137_udflow_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Secunda"]I considered it an honor back then, at least.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Blandus"]But the program itself is nothing to be proud of, Secunda.
[name="Blandus"]The concept was born nearly two centuries ago, a far cry from the average citizen's impression today. It was only twenty-some years ago that Ulpianus made it into a reality.
[name="Blandus"]In the hundred plus years before that, it was never afforded any systematic scrutiny or research. Only endless debates.
[name="Blandus"]To exploit our countrymen and integrate the flesh of other species into ourselves to save our humanity was tantamount to toppling the very foundations of Ægir.
[name="Blandus"]But Ulpianus is a decisive man. He can abandon his research, ideals, emotions, and even his humanity without a shred of hesitation. The sole principle he abides by is 'To benefit Ægir.'
[name="Blandus"]And perhaps he <i>will</i> save Ægir someday, but our country should not be founded upon boundless self-sacrifice.
[name="Blandus"]Ulpianus understands better than anyone that his very existence is actually his country's woe.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Blandus"]And so, 'The Abyssal Hunters do not need a second Ulpianus. Ægir should not have a second Ulpianus.'
[name="Blandus"]'There should be no one in Ægir who wishes to become another.'
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_4137_udflow_1#1$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#8$1",focus="r")]
[name="Blandus"]I once joked to him how much better it would be if you were my student instead. Perhaps you could continue the research he and I used to work on: 'The evolution of Ægir cells.' Or perhaps you'd start a new field entirely.
[name="Blandus"]You could have become one of the leading scientists of our time, with the opportunity to explore the primordial mysteries of all existence and lead us into the future.

Blandus no longer pays you any attention, his gaze falling back onto the holographic projections before him.
Through those squares you can clearly see Gladiia, Skadi, and Laurentina deep asleep in a transparent gel.
You didn't manage to get a full grasp of Ægir's writing system before coming here. After days of fumbling your way through the city, you can still only recognize about half the symbols shown in the visuals.
But you observe a more important phenomenon within them:
Whenever Blandus selects an image, it would emit a faint beep.
That is to say, every chosen image generates a corresponding beep on the monitoring unit.

[name="Blandus"]Interesting. The ancient sages once discussed the concept of 'fate,' but it's been a long time since anyone has brought it up.
[name="Blandus"]You see, Oripathy does not exist in the ocean, and most other diseases we managed to cure.
[name="Blandus"]We all choose our own paths in life, and the trajectory of our civilization is ours to define.
[name="Blandus"]For the longest time, we have forgotten what 'fate' even is.

[name="Blandus"]Yet now, the ineradicable disease we've engraved into our Hunters' blood cannot be dealt with medically.
[name="Blandus"]To borrow your concept, one may call such an problem 'fate.'
[name="Blandus"]Each of the Hunters held their own dreams, their own lives. But now? They have no choice but to live alongside slaughter until they die themselves.
[name="Blandus"]I've tried many methods to bring them back from this dead end, all to no avail.
