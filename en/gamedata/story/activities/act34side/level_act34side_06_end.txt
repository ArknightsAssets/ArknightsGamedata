[name="Blandus"]First of all, I noticed a baffling effect in your auto-adaptive junction...
[name="Blandus"]Your body's reaction is bizarre: when the Seaborn genes exert their abnormal dominance, your anti-Seaborn rejection response doesn't intensify. No, it actually lightens somewhat.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Which means my transformation is getting faster?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blandus"]No, quite the opposite.
[name="Blandus"]It was right as I was canceling the surgery that I observed a curious phenomenon. Once your rejection ebbed, your Seaborn genetics slowed down their influence.
[name="Blandus"]As if, to be crude, your body and the Seaborn genes had reached some sort of understanding.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ulpianus"]This is certainly worth further study. But for now, I need to know one thing: will this impact the Hunters in their upcoming battle?
[name="Ulpianus"]Slaying the Firstborn will be our single most important operation since we were created.
[name="Ulpianus"]At this point, I will allow no freak accidents.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blandus"]I've observed no negative effects so far. I'll be setting up a few more risk assessments before you head out.
[name="Blandus"]That said, if we're going to figure out what's underpinning this phenomenon, then you'd best come back alive so I have something to study at all.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blandus"]I'll be honest, I'm anxious.
[name="Blandus"]We've never waged a war on this scale before. We're marching every single Abyssal Hunter, plus three whole standing Legions, off into a single trench...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ulpianus"]If not with a war like this, how would we ever kill their genesezoic, their source, their 'god'?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#10$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#8$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blandus"]The truth is, I should've vetoed this project at the audit stage. A roadmap to warping evolution, predicated on sacrificing our own people's humanity.
[name="Blandus"]If not for you, I wouldn't have even entertained its feasibility, let alone poured ten years of my own blood and sweat into it.
[name="Blandus"]...But it's a sunk cost now. The more I doubt it, the more crucial it is for me be its core member, to steer it with my own two hands.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blandus"]Yet I can't shake the thought of how many 'monsters' this lab's created.

[name="Ulpianus"]Yes.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#7$1", focus="l")]

[name="Blandus"]You haven't seen the casualty report for that campaign yet, have you?
[name="Blandus"]You should have a read. Abyssal Hunters, legionnaires... Their sacrifices, a tragedy, yet the ending a farce!
[name="Blandus"]Violent resistance was always a dead end. The project was dead in the water from the start.
[name="Blandus"]Granted, Ægir's never used crude platitudes or propaganda to encourage such sacrifice. Every one of the project's subjects was given the freedom to make an informed decision...
[name="Blandus"]But using the sacrifice of our citizens as a market standard, well, THAT makes the very question of free choice much ado about nothing.
[name="Blandus"]Once, an Ægir's worth lay in all that they had built up and created during their life. And now? Our very lives, even our deaths, are price-tagged.

[name="Ulpianus"]Blandus, I expected your suspicion and dissent to drive you to search deeper, not reduce you to the cowardly, self-deceiving man you are now.
[name="Ulpianus"]Whether out of passion or mourning, it's still the same brand of rhetoric spouted by every fallen claiming to foresee the fall of Ægir itself.
[name="Ulpianus"]Assigning a character to a nation, anthropomorphizing it to critique its values... Even as a method of inflating one's ego, it's shoddy at best.

[name="Blandus"]Well, you were right, it was absolutely worth the further study.
[name="Blandus"]The junction brought about a homeostasis in you on the microscopic level. Your body no longer rejected the Seaborn genes, and they miraculously stopped overtaking you.
[name="Blandus"]It may have been by chance, but in no time at all, I was able to reproduce your phenomenon on the macro scale. To an extent, I could delete the hostility Seaborn bore towards humankind.

[name="Blandus"]I haven't much longer now, *cough* *cough*... I can practically feel each second of my life slipping away... but it was worth it. I've done all I needed to.

[name="Blandus"]...Good.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#8$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blandus"]Then the project was a failure, but the Hunters still have a chance to fulfill their calling... yet not through senseless slaughter and sacrifice.
[name="Blandus"]You'll live to show your worth. Not die to give Ægir a few more final gasps.
[name="Blandus"]The Abyssal Hunters will be the start of a revised relationship between humanity and the Seaborn. If I can have them mistake humankind as their own, then maybe I can get the many to see Ægir as a neighbor.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ulpianus"]And you had your eyes on the Waterway Program all along.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blandus"]More precisely, the Waterway Program came to me first.
[name="Blandus"]Clementia reached out to me at practically the same time as the Institute. She let me in on both the gameplan for the Waterway Program, and the research project for the Class IV weapon array.
[name="Blandus"]Weapons rooted in biotech like them can impact Seaborn behavior at large. The theory grounding them has a natural affinity with the auto-adaptive junctions.
[name="Blandus"]By then, I'd already gathered the data I needed to perfect the junction tech. To the point that it was no longer limited to human subjects anymore.
[name="Blandus"]So, I made a tiny little tweak to the Class IVs. The instant they activate, we can close the book on our fight with the Seaborn.
[name="Blandus"]The Abyssal Hunters, the Class IVs, it'll all transcend the boundary of species. It'll become a path. A bridge.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1381_1#7$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blandus"]You can't make this up. Two centuries of constant war between Ægir and the Seaborn, and one little trick is likely all it takes to stop it.
[name="Blandus"]Maybe the severity of this war was a fiction from the very beginning. Now, I mean no offense to our predecessors, but at least we still have the power to choose a different path.

[name="Ulpianus"]You can't paint even a single proper picture, can you?
[name="Ulpianus"]Your own proven record as the scientist you were, thrown away. When I see you now, Blandus, I can only laugh.
[name="Blandus"]I've never heard you say so much in one breath, Ulpianus.
[name="Blandus"]You mean to tell me you despair, yes?

[name="Ulpianus"]The only one who ever despaired was you.
[name="Ulpianus"]So you have no right to go regretting anything, fighting anything. Not in front of me.
[name="Ulpianus"]Every fallen must be sentenced, and their every corpse should be hung from the dry reefs.
[name="Blandus"]...Is it even in you to sentence me?
[name="Blandus"]The campaign to slay the Firstborn was full of questionable points, and you stand as the greatest suspect. Everything you've done now puts you at odds with Ægir—
[name="Blandus"]This nation has rejected you.
[name="Ulpianus"]And so I have no choice but to take on your noble work?
[name="Ulpianus"]The man I knew would never have given this conman's rhetoric.
[name="Blandus"]I'm simply stating the facts.
[name="Ulpianus"]Then in this moment, the last I will ever spend as an Ægir, I sentence you.

Blandus says nothing back. Perhaps he's lost the energy, or given up on retorting. This dialogue of monologues has dragged on long enough, to the point it's begun to wear on him.
The golden holochart ripples before him. <i>Too bright</i>, he thinks—and so he closes his eyes.

From somewhere, a communication intrudes and shatters the brief silence. With it, he hears the shrill grinding of his old friend's anchor being dragged across the floor.
[playsound(key="$d_avg_ironchaindrop", volume=1)]
But only one thought makes it in time. He couldn't even give the Hunters a welcome-home hug.
