Ulpianus hears the rumbling of the city reorganizing above his head as he watches the lightless beacon tower slowly sinks into the depths.
The building that once supported the grand aspirations of his people is now a Seaborn brood nest.
The old and feeble will use their bodies as nutrients for the next generation. Their journeys will continue with their newborn kin.
This is how the Seaborn have always been. They spare nothing in their devotion to their kin, and do their utmost to nurture them.
The thought brings a brief moment of sickness to Ulpianus.
The weight of the great anchor in his hand stretches to his shoulder. The moment he realizes that he will never be recognized or remembered, he feels more clear-headed than ever.
He is yet unable to cut the disgusting connection between himself and the Seaborn, but he still have the strength to cut off the tide surging towards the city.
Gladiia was right. Battling in the rapidly proliferating nest might only hasten his assimilation. All that awaits him is death, or worse.
Ulpianus puts all his might into swinging his anchor.

As if able to read his thoughts, the tiny hatchlings gracefully avoid his swing before calmly flickering past the grip of his anchor. He adjusts his breathing, recalculates, and swings once more.

Then there are two, then three. The school of newborns link together into a fine path of light, illuminating the chaotic waves.
Adult Seaborn of all shapes crowd around them tightly, directing the currents and protecting them as they swim into the distance.

As a former consul of the Academy of Technology, one at the top of his field, Ulpianus is certain he is not mistaken. The steady flow of wondrous things streaming out of the beacon tower...
Are nanomachines once ensconced in there. A history cut off. A dream that died young.
As an Abyssal Hunter, he trusts his sense of smell as much as he does his scientific intuition. Their scent is no different from the Seaborn.
Those 'beacons,' dead in the cradle nearly two hundred years ago, now thrum with new life. Incubated by the Seaborn, they now swim together towards the tidal confluence on the surface.
[name="Ulpianus"]Have you not yet given up on these games, Ægir, despite your own noose around your neck? Or is this also a part of your plan?

At first, there was only a mote of fluorescence.
Then, a flowing line.
And after that, an elegant lattice, spreading out across the surface of the sea.

Billions of nanomachines sway alongside the children of the sea, bobbing up and down on the ocean waves.
Their shimmer is minute yet clear, indistinct yet unwavering. The passage of light reflects about among the Seaborns' bodies.
The currents connect every nest scattered across the seas. Seaborn gather together from every corner of the ocean for their excursion onto land, gracefully extending the paths of light.
They intertwine with one another. The golden net they weave is like a galaxy strewn across the sea's surface, from Milliarium down into the deepest depths of the ocean.
The Waterway. The network of the ocean, one connecting land and sea, one transcending chaotic space and placid time.
Bound together with We Many.
