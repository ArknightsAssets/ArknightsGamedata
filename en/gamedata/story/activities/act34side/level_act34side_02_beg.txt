[name="Avitus"]Conceived and established by Mártus, the great scholar of anthropology and prehistoric civilization, it is a public facility that has had a profound impact on the nation.
[name="Avitus"]Aside from the mutually-supporting atoll city clusters above sea level and the modular city networks in the trenches, most of our other cities have unique forms and designs.
[name="Avitus"]Yet even so, nearly all of them have chosen to adopt Mártus's design and establish their own Sophontheatrum.
[name="Avitus"]Look around you. This is a place for people to think, doubt, and debate, eventually coming to an understanding and making a decision. A coliseum of wits, if you will.

[name="Avitus"]But our professors liked to speak of his eccentricities. He was unmatched in theoretical and deductive reasoning, yet was always reluctant to draw a conclusion.
[name="Avitus"]Even on issues where the answer was plain to all, he would refuse to put the question to rest until after an extended debate with himself.
[name="Avitus"]Some would say that trapping himself in endless debate showed he cared too much about the value and meaning of things. But is that not in our human nature?
[name="Avitus"]Which is why he built the Sophontheatrum. We needed a place where we could engage in intellectual discourse, both with ourselves and with others.

[name="Specter"]But you said you transferred out of dome work. Why, when you've already formed such a special bond with our big, transparent friend above?

A thread of light leaves the massive coral-shaped terminal to surround her, forming a giant ethereal ring in the air that dances to the consul's words.
More threads weave together to form cities and tides, Hunters and Seaborn, transmuting words to images and giving substance to sound.
The crowd quiets down.

[name="Clementia"]The results of their physical examinations and Gladiia's mission report have been uploaded to the Sophontheatrum's terminal and are available for your perusal. I'm sure many of you have already done so.
[name="Clementia"]Concerning the irregular circumstances therein...
[name="Clementia"]I now call upon Consul Gladiia—leader of Ægir's Honor Exercitus, and Chief Designer of Warfare of the Abyssal Hunters—to answer your questions.

You navigate through several rows of Ægir and sit in one of the back rows. With plenty of room around you, you have a clear view of everything happening in the Sophontheatrum.
The tribunal has already begun. The speakers do not raise their voices, yet every word is clear in the massive ring-like structure. Gladiia steps forward, drawing everyone's gaze.
