Giant shipwrecks and Seaborn remains lie entangled in a grotesque embrace. Pale flakes descend like snow.
While some have given it a more romanticized name, marine snow, it does little to hide its cruel nature: fragments of organic matter, both Seaborn and human.
The sweetness of blood and the stench of death, intensified by the cannon's lingering heat, spread with the falling flakes.
