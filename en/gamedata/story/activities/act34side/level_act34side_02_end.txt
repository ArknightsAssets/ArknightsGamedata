[multiline(name="Blandus")]As such, your concerns are not without reason. But my answer is this:
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1381_1#8$1")]
[multiline(name="Blandus")]No—
[name="Blandus"]They will not become Seaborn.
[charslot]
The hall goes silent.
Blandus clears his throat.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1381_1#8$1")]
[name="Blandus"]Let me try to explain this in layman's terms.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1381_1#1$1")]
[name="Blandus"]Under ordinary circumstances, Seaborn genes exhibit abnormal dominance and will irreversibly overwrite any preexisting traits in their host.
[name="Blandus"]In Abyssal Hunters, however, we have managed to extend the timeline of this process until it far exceeds the natural lifespan of any given Hunter.
[name="Blandus"]Furthermore, the Academy of Technology made a critical breakthrough, allowing us to implant an 'auto-adaptive junction' in all the Hunters before their deployment to eradicate the Firstborn.
[name="Blandus"]The auto-adaptive junction was implanted at the splice point between human and Seaborn DNA to assist the Hunters in more closely monitoring their Seaborn genes.
[name="Blandus"]If the Seaborn genes exhibited abnormal dominance, the junction would signal the body to resist their attempt at taking over.
[name="Blandus"]While there has undoubtedly been some degree of decay of their auto-adaptive junctions after five years without maintenance, the changes they've undergone remain well within acceptable ranges.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1397_1#1$1")]
[name="Academy of Science Researcher"]So you say, Advisor, but there is a record of a failed auto-adaptive junction surgery in the Abyssal Hunter Lab archives.
