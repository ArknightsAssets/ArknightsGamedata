[name="Avitus"]I confessed everything. What I was thinking, what I did, what I saw but never spoke of.
[name="Avitus"]I accepted the tribunal's interrogation, but they did not believe I deserved to be labeled fallen. I had stood at the precipice and looked around. Perhaps even stuck a toe over the edge, but no more than that.

The contaminated coral shimmers in its multitudes. Countless fantastical lifeforms flit between them, using its glimmer to dispel the darkness of the depths. They grow. They form tides.
