[name="Kal'tsit"]The prehistoric ruins beneath the seabed are a gift from the ocean to Ægir. They nurtured your civilization, and have granted you power and knowledge far beyond the terrestrial nations.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#2$1")]
[name="Clementia"]As you say, Dr. Kal'tsit, responsibility.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_003_kalts_1#1$1")]

[name="Kal'tsit"]Just as I do not believe Ægir will rely on passive solutions. After all, isn't Millarium's departure from its home territories a proactive effort to create a new line of defense?
[name="Kal'tsit"]So, my question is, Madame Consul: what is Ægir's endgame for the Waterway?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#2$1")]
[name="Clementia"]...I have already told Gladiia Ægir's answer, that which you would call arrogant. You have the right to know as well.
[name="Clementia"]There is much on this planet that was not formed naturally... and Ægir does not believe they are unrelated.
[name="Clementia"]Be they wonders like the stargate and the twin moons, or calamities like Originium and the Seaborn, these phenomena cannot be random products of spontaneity. They must be interconnected in some way.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#3$1")]
[name="Clementia"]To solve the Seaborn problem at its source and stop Terra's crisis, we need to fully understand Terra, including the hidden secrets of the land.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#2$1")]
[name="Clementia"]But those are for the future. If you simply seek my answer for what's at hand...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#9$1")]
[name="Clementia"]My endgame for the Waterway is to ensure that hundreds of thousands of Millarium's inhabitants and tens of thousands of Penal Battalion troops in Gran Faro live to see Ægir's main force arrive.
