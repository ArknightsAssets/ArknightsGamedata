There are always chimes like little bells resounding from the dome, the result of countless tentacle-shaped bio-monitors analyzing the most minute changes in the ocean current.
Occasional dull roars echo faintly from the port, as warships coming to and from the harbor gracefully displace vast amounts of seawater, like gigantic fins.
The goods, flying through aerial optic cables in squeezed state to every household, emit a near-subsonic buzzing.
......
These myriad noises, varied yet not chaotic, have become the ambiance of Milliarium, long since faded into the background for its ten thousand or so residents.
But now, all those residents stop in their paces. They wonder if their ears are deceiving them.

It seems to lack hostility. Before Mon3tr's roar startled it, it simply stood there quietly, its featureless face illuminated by the coral-shaped terminal in the middle of the Sophontheatrum.
