[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Avitus"]I only ever found that diary by accident.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1387_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Cassia"]More than three hundred years ago, four great researchers studying the prehistoric civilization made incredible discoveries in the mantle ruins, bringing back countless precious technologies and data to Ægir.
[name="Cassia"]Compared to all those blueprints and theoretical papers, a transcript of voice-recorded diary is hardly worth anything.
[name="Cassia"]And so it gathered dust in the Academy of Science's databases. Until, thanks to your curiosity, it was deciphered and turned into a popular reading material.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Avitus"]Merely the musings of an ordinary Predecessor on his endless journey.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1387_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Cassia"]But I loved the story of that Predecessor.
[name="Cassia"]I enjoyed seeing reality through his eyes.
[name="Cassia"]How the connections between countless stars collapsed, how the trust between myriad races crumbled away. Goods were in short supply, technology was lost, philosophy and art fell silent...
[name="Cassia"]No matter how much hope and vision went into their great undertakings, they ultimately faded into silence... Just like those nanomachines interred within the beacon tower.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Avitus"]Did you empathize with his despair, Cassia?
[name="Avitus"]You've never shown a trace of that emotion, though. You even chose to have a child born into a world that could face ruin at any moment.
[name="Avitus"]That isn't the choice of someone who's lost all hope.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1387_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Cassia"]I don't feel a shred of despair. Really.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1387_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Cassia"]That old-fashioned, dispirited, middle-aged man... It's hard to imagine how I could empathize with him at all.
[name="Cassia"]I simply appreciated how, by borrowing from his past experiences, you ingeniously tore apart the magnificent facade covering the eyes of today's Ægir.
[name="Cassia"]'We must accept that the things and qualities we were once so proud of have no use now. Perhaps they have always been flawed, and this calamity merely exposed them.'
[name="Cassia"]Once free of worry over survival, people will begin to consider 'value.' We pray that our thoughts, our deeds, even our very existence will have value.
[name="Cassia"]Every one of Ægir's systems is designed around unearthing that value within people.
[name="Cassia"]However, value is fragile. You need only look at it from another angle, and the mighty will become the tiny. The hideous, the beautiful.
[name="Cassia"]It's a pity that, whether through apathy or inertia, people tend to not change viewpoints they are familiar with.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Avitus"]And so, people live on their immutable value. Were those values to crumble away, they would crumble alongside them.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1387_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Cassia"]Exactly.
[name="Cassia"]When did despair begin to blossom in <i>you</i>? Was it when Milliarium left the home territories? Or even earlier, after the passing of your Familiar?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1386_1#6$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1387_1#11$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_474_gladiia_1#1")]
[name="Gladiia"]Ægir may be the prehistoric civilization's heir, but that does not require its subservience. We need not condone the rise of... 'exhaustion and despair.'

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1382_1#2$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#14$1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Was it this rationality that led you to hastily throw the Hunters into the battle for the Waterway Program, despite their recent return?

[name="Gladiia"]Kal'tsit...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1382_1#9$1")]
[name="Clementia"]I invite the two of you to look at the beacon tower behind us. It was once an important component of the interstellar expedition our ancestors planned for.
[name="Clementia"]Within the tower lie countless nanomachines. The first Ægir city to break through the electron cloud would have seeded them throughout the sea of stars.
[name="Clementia"]They would self-proliferate, self-repair, and connect together into an ever bright road network. With this, our fleets would have been able to jump freely between the stars.
[name="Clementia"]After the outbreak of the Seaborn crisis, Ægir turned its eyes from the stars, and the bio-energy system requiring support from a dozen or so cities was cut off.
[name="Clementia"]The nanomachines were incompatible with other energy sources, so after losing their specialized source, they all 'died' within that tower.
[name="Clementia"]But our colleagues from the Academy of Technology have helped alter this tower to serve us in a different manner, by lighting our paths.
[name="Clementia"]Since Milliarium left the home territories, it has been continuously marking Seaborn nests. Huge volumes of data are now compiled within that tower's control center.
[name="Clementia"]With the precise locations of these Seaborn nests, our Class IV weapons can destroy the primary nest in any targeted area of ocean, driving away the occupying Seaborn.
[name="Clementia"]This will clear a path of pure water leading back to the home territories. One that can support a Waterway our main forces can pass through.
[name="Clementia"]Perhaps the Seaborn will eventually regroup, but at the very least, their accumulated nutrients will rot away in their absence, and any re-established nests will bear no fruit.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_003_kalts_1#1$1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]You are lecturing us on the core concept of the 'Waterway Program,' Madame Consul.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1382_1#9$1")]
[name="Clementia"]Yes I am, Doctor.
[name="Clementia"]The Abyssal Hunters only managed to save twenty-six lives in yesterday's battle. The Seaborn were clearly forewarned.
[name="Clementia"]Between the oceanic interior and the continental shelf, this city has been fighting them for far too long. They are now adapting to Class III weapons at a much faster rate.
[name="Clementia"]Nest 37's position is of particular import. It strangles the throat of the Waterway. Abandoning it would mean stumbling at the final hurdle.
[name="Clementia"]This is our final battle before the Waterway can be opened. We <i>must</i> gather all the force we can bear as part of the program. The Abyssal Hunters are no exception.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1382_1#4$1")]

[name="Tullia"]I'm really, really sorry; can you give me one more hour?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#1$1")]
[name="Tullia"]<i>Caulerpa archaeosphaeridium</i>, <i>Hypnea fenestralis</i>, <i>Halymenia fimbriatus</i>, <i>Palmaria purpureus</i>, <i>Sargassum pennata</i>... There's not too many left. I'll finish cataloging them real quick!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4079_haini_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucilla"]No need to rush, Tullia. I'm just here for a routine inspection.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#1$1")]
[name="Tullia"]You know who I am?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4079_haini_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucilla"]Mhm. We were in the same batch before the transfer assessment by the Institute of Development Planning. You might not remember me, though.
[name="Lucilla"]Are you preparing to transport these seaweeds?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#4$1")]
[name="Tullia"]Th-This doesn't violate any protocols, does it?!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4079_haini_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucilla"]Calm down. This building's handover procedures are already complete. If you leave the samples and cultivation equipment behind, you'll end up having to pack them away in bulk.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#11$1")]
[name="Tullia"]Thanks for the warning.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4079_haini_1#9$1")]
[name="Lucilla"]But with all these seaweeds, how could you possibly take them all away at once?
[name="Lucilla"]Now that it's close to land, Milliarium will be undergoing targeted reformation. The city won't have the space or the resources to breed seaweeds.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#11$1")]
[name="Tullia"]Yeah, I know.
[name="Tullia"]I'll take as much as I can. I'll think of something, some way that won't inconvenience anyone.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4079_haini_1#10$1")]
[name="Lucilla"]But the base by the volcano is already...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#3$1")]
[name="Tullia"]That was once Ægir's biggest endangered plants reserve. I saw it get swallowed up by the Seaborn.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#1$1")]
[name="Tullia"]These primitive seaweeds are some of the simplest, yet most tenacious lifeforms in the entire ocean.
[name="Tullia"]Whether in bright shallow seas, the dark abyss, the flat sea floor, or cracks in the cliffs, they stretch out as best they can.
[name="Tullia"]And they're as old as the ocean itself, pretty much this planet's living fossils.
[name="Tullia"]I'm no legionnaire, and I can't go fight the Seaborn. These remaining seaweeds won't help us solve the Seaborn problem, either.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#9$1")]
[name="Tullia"]But I can't just let them wither away in here.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4079_haini_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucilla"]...You really love your work, huh Tullia?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#1$1")]
[name="Tullia"]Um, don't you?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4079_haini_1#4$1")]
[name="Lucilla"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#8$1")]
[name="Tullia"]Ah, my Little Handy sent over a loading module. Sorry, but I can't stay and chat.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4079_haini_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucilla"]Do you need any help?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1385_1#11$1")]
[name="Tullia"]No thanks, I'm fine.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4079_haini_1#9$1")]
[name="Lucilla"]The day before the Institute of Ecological Art relocated.
[name="Lucilla"]I don't know what happened to her after that, and I don't know if she thinks Milliarium <i>abandoned</i> the volcanic power station and the plants reserve...
[name="Lucilla"]But I can't imagine her doing anything bad because of it... because she's never abandoned anything herself.
