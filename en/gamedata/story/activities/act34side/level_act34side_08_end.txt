[name="Gladiia"]Consul Horatia.
[name="Horatia"]Whyever do you look so fatigued, my little Gladiia?
[name="Horatia"]Though the transmission efficiency of the Waterway is much higher than I anticipated, I fear our simulacra are still unable to transmit my feelings.
[name="Horatia"]Otherwise I'd stroke your hair and give you a nice, big hug.
[name="Gladiia"]No need. You know the risks of doing so.
[name="Gladiia"]The changes on the sea's surface, as well as the sudden appearance of the 'Waterways'. Was this your doing?
[name="Horatia"]Whether Ægir or Seaborn, we all find ourselves competing over time.
[name="Horatia"]The Seaborn must keep sending nutrients to every region of sea they conquer. They wish to quickly transform the entire continental shelf into one great nest.
[name="Horatia"]Every issue has two sides. This disaster has also blessed us with bio-energy beyond measure.
[name="Horatia"]More than two centuries ago, the beacon launcher would have required a dozen cities' bio-energy systems to continually fabricate the nanomachines comprising the Waterways.
[name="Horatia"]Now, those nanomachines are being fostered by the Seaborn, who regard them as harmless kin.
[name="Horatia"]Using the data flow between the nanomachines as a medium, fleets and cities in squeezed state could traverse the oceans in an instant.
[name="Horatia"]Though these machines cannot take Ægir to the stars as our forebears imagined, they are more than enough to carve a path of life for civilization in its time of need.
[name="Gladiia"]But that would mean that, for the foreseeable future, Ægir will have no choice but to enter into some kind of <i>symbiosis</i> with the Seaborn, using that... scum, as they in turn use us.
[name="Gladiia"]Is this another of your so-called 'games'?
[name="Horatia"]It is how we will break through this siege.
[name="Horatia"]The term 'Waterway,' the path ahead for Ægir, has never referred only to pure waters.
[name="Horatia"]You have always had your doubts about the Program, and that is fine. But if that doubt serves only to put you in disarray, then it is useless.
[name="Horatia"]As Ægir is determined to open a Waterway between sea and land, there was no question that it shall do so.
[name="Kal'tsit"]I do not doubt your success, but perhaps there is still room for debate as to your methods.
[name="Horatia"]Dr. Kal'tist, I presume. Consul Horatia, of the Institute of Scientific Development Planning. It's a pleasure.
[name="Horatia"]It pleases me that there are still those on dry land who have inherited the will of the prehistoric civilization. That Ægir is not alone in our duty.
[name="Horatia"]I am also glad to see you have begun our discussion with a firm diplomatic stance.
[name="Horatia"]Then can I take it that you speak for all terrestrial civilizations, and that we can dispense with establishing diplomacy with them one by one?
[name="Kal'tsit"]I, too, am glad to see Ægir abandon its contentment in isolation and seek out cooperation with the land.
[name="Kal'tsit"]But I regret to inform you, Madame Consul, that I do not represent it in its entirety. I merely understand it more than most.
[name="Kal'tsit"]That said, I believe what Ægir needs now is exactly a thorough understanding of the terrestrial civilizations.
[name="Kal'tsit"]You and I both know that this Waterway will not be used only for resisting the Seaborn. Ægir has its eyes on every unnatural existence in these lands.
[name="Horatia"]It is the only means for us to ascertain the intrinsic nature of Terra, and to eliminate the disasters hanging above our heads at the source.
[name="Kal'tsit"]And I am sure you are aware of how such actions will be perceived by the terrestrial nations.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Compared to the Seaborn, you would be seen as the more direct threat.
[name="Horatia"]We bear them no ill will. We need not stoop so low.
[name="Horatia"]The cruelest thing we could do is ignore the need of help of other tottering civilizations we meet on the road to settling this crisis.

[name="Horatia"]Hah, I'm not <i>that</i> strict a mother.
[charslot]
With her left hand on the astrolabe, Horatia's right hand softly strokes her cheek below her right ear, where a thin scar stretches upwards, nearly touching her eye.
There is a smile on her face.

[name="Horatia"]But this is no blemish. It's beautiful. Trivial for a doctor to erase, but I refuse.
[name="Horatia"]My little Gladiia was barely five at the time. She was taking her first career development assessment, and through this made her wishes rather clear.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#1$1")]
[name="Clementia"]I remember when she was two, the Institute of Incubation said your disposition and the nature of your work made you ill-suited to raise her, and suggested you place her in their care.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1384_1#1$1", afrom=0.8, ato=0.8, duration=0)]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1384_1#4$1", afrom=0.8, ato=0.8, duration=0)]
[name="Horatia"]Very well, Consul Clementia.
[name="Horatia"]While we spoke, every city in the home territories has been conducting an unprecedented investigation into the Church of the Deep.
[name="Horatia"]As the core of R&D, Blandus was able to tamper with the Class IV weapons, but his actions should absolutely have been detected at some point before they were put to use.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#9$1")]

[name="Horatia"]All members of both Academies who had anything to do with the weapons' design, manufacture, and maintenance are receiving the most thorough investigations possible.
[name="Horatia"]In response, the Church has brought their full influence to bear. By grasping at a single leaf, we may be able to pull out an entire rotten branch.
[name="Horatia"]And with Mártus, no doubt we will be able to identify the Church's deepest roots.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#10$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1384_1#3$1", afrom=0.8, ato=0.8, duration=0)]
[name="Horatia"]Surgery to cut out a festering tumor. Isn't it?
[name="Horatia"]The Waterway is open, and the fallen who corrupt our nation have been revealed. Both are of great value, as I see it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#9$1")]

[name="Horatia"]Why do you insist on double negatives? They make you seem weak.
[name="Horatia"]There is no such thing as a 'superficial' program in Ægir, Consul Clementia.
[name="Horatia"]If the IDP has approved a program, it means its planning and members are entrusted with the hopes of Ægir.
[name="Horatia"]We believed you are capable of using the Class IV weapons to purify our waters and open the Waterway. This has always been an official part of the program.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#9$1")]
[name="Clementia"]...Yet it failed.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1384_1#1$1", afrom=0.8, ato=0.8, duration=0)]
[name="Horatia"]The theoretical success rate of oceanic purification was never high. However, the Waterway Program was a guaranteed success.
[name="Horatia"]Did I not promise you that, before you set off? Trust in me. Trust in Ægir.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#9$1")]
[name="Clementia"]I don't doubt that even if this city were to sink, consigning all ten thousand or so Ægir souls in it to the depths, the Waterway would still open without hitch.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#10$1")]
[name="Clementia"]However, of all the possibilities you've accounted for, how many call for sacrifice?

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1384_1#8$1", afrom=0.8, ato=0.8, duration=0)]
[name="Horatia"]Is that why you've worked yourself to the bone, my little manta ray?
[name="Horatia"]I've read the reports on Milliarium. As consul for the entire city, you need not throw yourself into each and every little affair.
[name="Horatia"]The stimulants you abuse will not hide the exhaustion on your face.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#10$1")]
[name="Clementia"]You really have thought of everything. As you always do, Horatia.
[name="Clementia"]All these losses and sacrifices, the falls and the betrayals, even Mártus's secret... Are you not the least bit shaken?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1384_1#5$1", afrom=0.8, ato=0.8, duration=0)]
[name="Horatia"]Speaking of Mártus... You've reminded me of something.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#10$1")]
[name="Clementia"]Of what?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1384_1#5$1", afrom=0.8, ato=0.8, duration=0)]
[name="Horatia"]Mártus regards himself as the 'gardener of sin'. At times like these, he is wont to hide himself behind history.
[name="Horatia"]I can infer why he'd seek cooperation from Dr. Kal'tsit, but from the way you describe it, those 'discussions' quickly devolved into a vapid declaration of war.
[name="Horatia"]I find it difficult to imagine he would be satisfied with such a failure of negotiations. That is, unless he gained some other information...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#10$1")]
[name="Clementia"]We will continue to track his whereabouts.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1384_1#12$1", afrom=0.8, ato=0.8, duration=0)]

[name="Clementia"]......

Clementia does not answer. She instead raises her head to look at Horatia, face to face. With the simulacrum erasing the distance between them, she knows that Horatia will be able to see every detail of her expression.
But the curve of Horatia's lips do not change, her eyes are as gentle as ever, too.
Clementia hopes that her own expression is as firm as hers.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#10$1")]
