The Consul's Pensivarium sits high in the city. The seawater hangs just above their heads.
The transparent dome serves as a gentle mirror, warding off the deep and foreboding void while granting the Ægir the solace of introspection.
Beneath the dome, the entire city is bathed in a blue hue. The beacon launchpad stands tall at its center, while ships glide in and out of the distant docks like schools of fins.
[name="Clementia"]The sea itself has no color, only darkness. Milliarium stands in its murky depths like the vigilant eye of civilization, solitary and luminous.
[name="Clementia"]We once had many such cities. One by one, the stars in the sea went out, becoming sustenance for the Seaborn.
[name="Clementia"]All that's left on the seafloor are their colorful, eerie nests.
[name="Gladiia"]I won't deny that the Abyssal Hunter project was a failed gambit. The death of the Firstborn did not stop their evolution.
[name="Gladiia"]So I want to know what solution Ægir has come up with next. What you have come up with.
[name="Gladiia"]What is this Waterway Program?
[name="Clementia"]Gladiia, I didn't mean...
[name="Clementia"]I'm simply part of an even bigger gambit, one with even higher stakes.
[name="Clementia"]The weapon classification scheme remains nothing more than a strict control over weapon usage to delay the evolution of the Seaborn.
[name="Clementia"]This time, however, we have taken into account every weapon at our disposal or under development.
[name="Clementia"]A mix of conventional ballistics and Class I weapons initially proved highly effective. The Seaborn were unable to comprehend why they were being burned by the seawater around them.
[name="Clementia"]But it took them only a year to adapt. 11 months in, we accelerated the adoption of Class II weapons, which operated on completely different principles.
[name="Clementia"]Et cetera, et cetera.
[name="Gladiia"]Until their evolution outpaced the ability of the Academy of Technology to innovate.
[name="Clementia"]Yes. At day's end, all we're doing is merely buying time. Ægir has committed vast resources to study the Seaborn. To eradicate them at their origin, we must first comprehend them at their source.
[name="Clementia"]The information you've brought back is highly valuable, and Breogan's discovery on land corroborates the Academy of Science's research.
[name="Gladiia"]The Seaborn and the Feranmuts share the same genesis.
[name="Gladiia"]Is Ægir coming ashore to seek memories even more ancient?
[name="Clementia"]Not just that. The Seaborn share a common genesis with the Feranmuts, but much about them is very different. Unnatural, one might say.
[name="Clementia"]Their recent activity demonstrates a clear sense of purpose. They have quickly abandoned their reliance on the sea and begun to migrate towards land en masse.
[name="Clementia"]Left unchecked, it is not out of the question that all of Terra could become infested with Seaborn.
[name="Gladiia"]We already saw hints of that in Iberia.
[name="Clementia"]Thus, for Ægir, the land is both a source of answers and a solemn responsibility.
[name="Clementia"]Horatia has issued new war orders on behalf of the Institute of Development Planning, and Milliarium has come bearing new Class IV weapons from the Academy of Technology.
[name="Clementia"]They are a form of biological weapon, very different from all previous ones. Designed to induce death in nearby Seaborn nests and newborns, while driving away adults from the area.
[name="Clementia"]We have successfully located most of the nests in the target region. The ones near Iberia are the only ones yet unmarked.
[name="Clementia"]Once the beacons have been placed and the weapons activated, we will finally have cleared an entire region of Seaborn, and established a route back to Ægir's home territories.

[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Clementia"]Yes. It could be the key to solving the mystery of the Seaborn. Or the path that leads us to destruction.
[name="Clementia"]Could a Hunter survive for months on Seaborn remains and remain lucid? Would a lucid hunter willingly stay with them, rather than returning to civilization?
[name="Clementia"]There are too many unanswered questions about Ulpianus and that fateful operation.
