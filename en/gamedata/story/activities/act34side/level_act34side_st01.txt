[name="Clementia"]I installed an Iberian language module before leaving the home territories. I hope you'll forgive me if I ever use the wrong expression.
[name="Clementia"]Moreover, forgive me for having to contact you in this form, Sir... Iberia.
[name="Saint Carmen"]We have no objections to your appearance, Madame Consul. I only regret that it has taken us so long to begin this conversation.
[name="Saint Carmen"]Despite your so-called 'Waterway' project being more than half-complete and close at hand, we Iberians find ourselves in complete ignorance of it.
[name="Clementia"]To make amends, we'd like to invite your envoys to visit our city. Ægir respects the efforts Iberia has made when you were caught up in the Seaborn crisis.
[name="Saint Carmen"]'Caught up in.' Do you mean to say that everything Iberia has faced was merely the aftermath of <i>your</i> crisis?
[name="Clementia"]I do.
[name="Clementia"]Let's not be tied down by formalities, Sir.
[name="Clementia"]We recognize the power of language. Your name itself, Carmen I Iberia, is a symbol. A symbol of courage and valor.
[name="Clementia"]This is why we came to you. We hope that by reaching an accord with Iberia and the other terrestrial nations, we will be able to create a Waterway that links directly to land.
[name="Clementia"]We will clear the stretch of sea between Ægir's home territories and the land, so as to facilitate our forces coming ashore.
[name="Saint Carmen"]...I hope I need not remind you what sending an army to another nation's border implies on land.
[name="Clementia"]Given the enormity of the oncoming threat, we will exhaust every means at our disposal to resist it.
[name="Clementia"]I am more than willing to come explain to you in person if necessary, but it would be easier for you to understand the situation if you were to join us in the depths.
[name="Clementia"]The fleets of our Legions VIII and X are patrolling and suppressing the Seaborn in these waters. They will soon escort you to our city of Milliarium.
[name="Clementia"]This drone formation will continue to notify you of any nearby combat or environmental changes until you have safely arrived at the city.
[name="Clementia"]There may be an unprecedented disaster brewing beneath the waves.
[name="Clementia"]Sir Inquisitor, I worry that though the earth is vast, it is but an isolated island.

Ulpianus swims into the nest.
He chooses not to use stealth. Luminescent vegetative Seaborn light up every corner of the nest. There is nowhere to hide in the first place.
Atop sets of spiraling blades, minute and curiously-shaped organisms sleep, or perhaps drift along.
The rocks of the seafloor cannot be seen. The fine tendrils of the nethersea brand slowly sway in the current, catching fragments of organic matter. They weave together into thick mats, drowning out any sound Ulpianius makes.
He can sense the changes in his own body. His consciousness extends and his body relaxes, as though every cell in his body is trying to respond to something.
He is clearly an invader, but the entire lair blooms in response to him.
[name="Seaborn"]Ul... Ul-pian... Guh... Ul-pianus. Kin.
Ulpianus is nearly able to see through the approaching Seaborn's translucent body. He waits for it to spit out its clumsy words about preying or being preyed on by him, but nothing comes.
The Seaborn thinks about his thoughts.
[name="Seaborn"]Finally. You have traveled far.
[name="Seaborn"]Here. Sufficient nutrients. Shed your cumbersome flesh.
[name="Seaborn"]Return. Grow. Migrate.
[name="Ulpianus"]Hmph.
[name="Seaborn"]For you, I was born, Ul-pianus. Only for you.
[name="Seaborn"]I untangle your. Doubt. I guide you. Return to the embrace of we many.
[name="Ulpianus"]Why did you migrate? Where will you go?
[name="Seaborn"]You still waver, Ul-pianus.
[name="Seaborn"]You must know we many, kin. You must know.
[name="Seaborn"]The genesezoic will soon awaken. The genesezoic must return. A new Cycle. Develop the ocean. Leave the ocean.
[name="Ulpianus"]The genesezoic will awaken? Leave the ocean?
[name="Seaborn"]We many. See. A new path ahead. We hurry—
[name="Ulpianus"]...What connection is there between you and the affairs of the city?
