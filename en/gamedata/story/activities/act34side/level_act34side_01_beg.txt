[name="Ægir Researcher B"]Hydrogen from seawater can be used to maintain operation of the Legion fleet, but it would be difficult to guarantee uninterrupted energy supply to the beacon.

[name="Irene"]I'm here representing the Iberian Inquisition. I've seen the files on the slaughters... Each report on its own may be thin, but in aggregate...
[name="Irene"]We committed many injustices while cleansing the influence of the Church of the Deep, and the Islanders were the most affected.
[name="Irene"]I still believe the Inquisition was in no position to be lenient, not when the country itself teetered on the brink.
