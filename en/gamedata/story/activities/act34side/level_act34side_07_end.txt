[name="Kal'tsit"]The destruction of prehistoric civilization?
[name="'Seaborn'"]Yes. Ægir never discovered the reason for its destruction, but I saw a vision of it before my eyes.

[name="'Seaborn'"]It was the end of prehistoric civilization, and the calamity that Terra must face. It is the end of all things.
[name="'Seaborn'"]The horrifying images left me as I pulled my hand back, replaced by another image. One that was broken, blurred, chaotic.
[name="'Seaborn'"]He and His children shall devour all that is living, and consume the moons and the stars. All that is living and dead shall nourish Him, and He shall murmur at the end of time—

[name="'Seaborn'"]Over and over. Survive.
[name="Kal'tsit"]'Chaotic', 'murmur'... was the Feranmut asleep?
[name="'Seaborn'"]He was trapped within a dream. The dream stagnated, evolution stagnated, duty stagnated. He was trapped in the cerulean cave.

[name="Kal'tsit"]Your description raises many questions.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The feasibility of modifying a Feranmut into a biological ark by leveraging its habit of fostering an independent ecosystem inside its body had already been verified on Talos.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The technology used by the project was mature.
[name="Kal'tsit"]And their complex was deep in the mantle. Energy coming from the heart of the planet could support the facilities' operation for almost an eternity.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The project had more than sufficient power supply.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Why, then, did the project deep beneath the ocean 'stagnate,' as you put it, and go out of control, releasing innumerable Seaborn?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1383_1#1$1")]
[name="'Seaborn'"]The existence of Feranmut was introverted by nature, yet He was to turn all things to nourishment for His survival. He was given meaning that did not belong to Him, and a name that did not belong to Him—Ishar-mla.
[name="'Seaborn'"]The changes They were put to were bolder, wilder, more ambitious, and more despairing. Their nature had long since exceeded the biological ark you speak of.
[name="'Seaborn'"]For unknown reasons, however, Their subsequent actions did not follow the program.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_003_kalts_1#14$1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Meaning that the project did not proceed along the planned lines, but the new direction was also interrupted?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1383_1#1$1")]
[name="'Seaborn'"]Not entirely. He—They continue to foster new offspring within themselves.
[name="'Seaborn'"]But the lives trapped within the Feranmut were weak. They evolved too slowly.
[name="'Seaborn'"]The new generation needed to be liberated. They needed to leave the Feranmut's body, adapt to new environments, and obtain more nutrition.
[name="'Seaborn'"]More nutrition to be fed back to the Feranmut, so that His evolution may be accelerated.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_003_kalts_1#1$1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Under normal circumstances, the organisms nurtured within a Feranmut are rarely able to venture beyond its body. Yet the aggression the Seaborn have demonstrated outside...
[name="Kal'tsit"]The modifications these Feranmuts have undergone were indeed transformative.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1382_1#9$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1383_1#3$1")]

Having sailed for thousands of miles, Milliarium rises to the surface of the ocean after casting out its heart.
Every inch of it is being reformed, supported by its framework. An invisible forcefield extends towards the bottom of the sea and the highest reaches of the sky, forming a structure like a great wall.
The structure breaks the surface of the ocean, creating a giant wave a hundred meters tall. However, on the other side of the city, the real tide has arrived—
It is a living wave. Seaborn of various forms have fused with the ocean. The children of the sea are the sea itself; they have even changed the color of the water.
The city from the depths and the roiling tide stretch out at the same time, colliding, embracing, and ripping at each others' throats.
Nature never tires, yet civilization will not stop its footsteps.

All is quiet. No wind dares tell of what it sees, here and now.
