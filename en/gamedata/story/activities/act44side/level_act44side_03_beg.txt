[name="Mifune"]The 'Ao-Oni of Kinsekikai', the 'Single-horned Oni', among many more nicknames.
[name="Mifune"]A female Oni with one horn, long green hair, of tall and sturdy build. Said to carry a large triangular shield.
[name="Mifune"]She vanished two decades ago, spawning the myth that she was haunting the city as a vengeful spirit late at night, killing anyone who'd been connected with her.
[name="Mifune"]Many attendees report seeing this individual at Momoka-san's concert.
[name="Mifune"]As for whether she is truly a living being, a pretender, or a genuine ghost—we are as yet uncertain.
[name="Mifune"]As the man responsible for the company Momoka-san is contracted to, I make a sincere appeal for the general public to contact us with any clues. You will be rewarded handsomely.
[name="Mifune"]I'm sure Momoka-san also harbors hope that you will help her out of her plight...
