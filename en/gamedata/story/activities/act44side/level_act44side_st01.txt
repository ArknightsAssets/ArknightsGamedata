The pain in her belly becomes a raging inferno that churns together with the fury in her mind, bursting its way out of her chest.
Unlike the chivalrous yakuza who walked against the flow, who knew right from wrong and believed in the justice she had always upheld, now, she has devolved into a vicious Oni, one who knows nothing but slaughter.
The Hannya in her hands can no longer be controlled by the great wisdom in scripture it is named for. All that is left is a frenzied fury that burns hotter than the face of Hannya, uncaring of former friendships.
