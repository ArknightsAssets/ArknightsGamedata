Gazing down from the top of the TV tower, one can see fireworks rise in the night sky before falling gently and disappearing from sight.
The fireworks show has not begun yet. This is simply the warmup for the warmup.
The Phidia gazes at his own reflection in the window, and that of the reforged Hannya behind him.

Kaidan. Hot topics. Manipulation of public opinion.
It has become second nature to him.
Who would have thought that all the kaidan of Mitsukue originated from Shimasu's attempt to blackmail him over the Diet candidate affair, only to end up slain by his sword?
Shimasu's death needed to be covered up. The fledgling TV station needed relevance. The diet member whom he was trying to butter up was waiting to see him prove his quality.
So he linked Hoshiguma with 'Sawara the Silentious' of Shin-Aki, and reported on the Haunted House for a week. It was a smashing success.
The intensive reporting dispelled any suspicions that viewers had, and left behind plenty of room for him to clean up and misdirect.
Relevance from the kaidan became money. Money moved diet members and shackled the police, made the Kinsekikai grovel before him, and rendered Tessai powerless to intervene.
Everything snowballed from there. The Haunted House became the ideal place to dispose of people who got in the way.
But the trick could not continue forever. Interest would fade, and revenue would decline, while Tessai's suspicions and the pressure of public opinion grew.
When the last gangster who knew how the Diet candidate died was dealt with, he began to expand the scope and channels of the 'kaidan'.
It could involve the kami or accidents, even a fabricated story that was sufficiently interesting and frightening.
He, too, wondered why the people of Mitsukue were so obsessed with kaidan.
They feared any potential danger in life, but they could not control their own curiosity. The prospect of danger seemed to represent a fatal attraction.
The TV station provided the Kinsekikai with a constant source of income, funding the crystalline component industry, making him someone whom Tessai looked down on, but could not do without him.
Meanwhile, to him, Tessai was already nothing more than a...

On Nita Street and beyond, all of Mitsukue is suddenly filled with red lights, with the exception of the oblivious fireworks.
A fear that was once forgotten has been reawakened.
Conflict between North and South has only increased since the Bloodpeak Campaign, but rapid economic growth caused the attention of the people to drift away from the gunfire on the border.
Mizukue and Kusarigawa continued to treat each other as potential adversaries, even after the '90s, but the average folk have long since forgotten the possibility.
This fear, which has lain forgotten for many years but never truly left, seized the hearts of Mitsukue's people more powerfully than any kaidan.

As Sarasa said, the broadcasts are now changing to play the retraction video, and the crowd gradually begins to calm down.
As Hoshiguma walks, she wonders if she might see the reaction she hoped for from the crowd.
It need not be an awakening or an awareness of vigilance, nothing so heavy.
She just wants to see them shiver and remember what fear truly is, not just a little punctuation to spice up a happy life.
But all she hears is people excitedly repeating a single word...

She draws her sword.
The yakuza who have heard of the Ao-Oni instinctively take a step backwards. Only one of the younger members steps forward, seemingly oblivious to what he is risking for a chance at glory.

No one saw what the one-horned Oni did. All they saw was a blue flash, and the young yakuza fell to the ground, a bloody gash on his thigh.

They rush toward the striding Oni like the tide.
The Oni takes step after step forward, until the distance between her and the figure ahead closes to a hair's breadth—
Once again, the blue light, but this time, everyone sees the true nature of the Oni, no longer attempting to suppress her fury.

Hoshiguma's blade moves through the air.
Before long, there is no longer anyone standing in her way. The injuries are not fatal, but no one has the strength, or the stomach, to oppose her anymore. Only the one-horned Oni still stands tall.
