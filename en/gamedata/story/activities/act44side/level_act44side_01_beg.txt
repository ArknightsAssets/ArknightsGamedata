[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1896_1#6$1")]
[name="Mifune"]Yes, the statute of limitations is up, so on what grounds are the police still detaining people? I want a justification—one that can withstand a Diet inquiry, a televised hearing, and the court of public opinion.

They exit the police station, turn right, and cross the street.
Nita Street unfolds before Hoshiguma, in broad daylight.
The harsh white sun shines down on the street, draining the buildings of their neon shimmer and baring the raw concrete beneath.
The morning commute is in full swing. Expressionless office workers hurry past shops that are either still closed or trying half-heartedly to drum up business—none of them look nearly as glamorous as they did under the moonlight.
Who was it that threw up on the street last night? Which man was persuaded to empty his wallet at the club? Under the light of day, they all look the same.

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_136_hsguma_1#5$1",focus="l")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]I figured, after all this time, nobody thought of me as one of the Kinsekikai anymore.

[name="Mifune"]How? No matter how fate plays its tricks or how long you've been incommunicado—as long as you come back, then you're still family.
[name="Mifune"]Over the past two decades, has the Kinsekikai ever issued you an 'expulsion' or 'no-contact' notice? Never.
[name="Mifune"]Say what you will, but even now, at every official meeting, the seat to the Old Man's left is still left empty. You've always been the Kinsekikai's <i>wakagashira</i>—the heir apparent.

[name="Mifune"]If you hadn't offed that Diet candidate twenty years ago, before I could get to him too, the Kinsekikai would've been driven out of Kajimachi—crushed under the weight of his public pressure campaign.
[name="Mifune"]Then, you made sure the rest of us were in the clear, taking all the heat for the killing. You fled to Lungmen alone, which allowed the Kinsekikai to survive.
[name="Mifune"]You've sacrificed so much for us. If we just turned our backs on you, what kind of family would that make us?

The tall Phidia hastens his steps and hurries off towards Kajimachi.
He walks so fast, and with such long strides, that Hoshiguma has to break into a jog just to keep up.
