[name="Mifune"]If Chairman Tessai will not hand over Kajimachi whatsoever, then I must take the small liberty of taking over the leadership of the Kinsekikai. After all, the position is already little more than a figurehead.

[name="Mifune"]Tameshigiri? Wonderful.
[name="Mifune"]I have something to show you before that, though.
[charslot]
Mifune reaches into his clothes.
Tessai keeps a careful eye on his movements, but all Mifune does is take out a few photos, casually tossing them to the floor.
Tessai catches a glimpse of one of the photos, which falls face-up in front of him—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1895_1#5$1")]
[name="Tessai"]Tetsuya?!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#9$1")]
[name="Mifune"]Tetsuya.
[name="Mifune"]Such a good boy. He did everything I asked of him to the limits of his ability, whether he could ultimately handle it or not.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#10$1")]
[name="Mifune"]For example, he really did find the Northern Court spy... himself.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1895_1#6$1")]
[name="Tessai"]Why—you?!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1")]
[name="Mifune"]I was surprised when I first saw the photos, but then it started to make sense.
[name="Mifune"]Tetsuya's mother may have missed her family in the north, but she steadfastly refused any approach to become a spy.
[name="Mifune"]Yet the mark of Hoashi was on all the weapons that we, the Kinsekikai, procured in secret.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#2$1")]
[name="Mifune"]My fault, I suppose. The Kinsekikai's TV station wasn't as powerful as it is now, and those who wanted a piece of the Kinsekikai would have set upon the news like hungry beasts.
[name="Mifune"]Eventually, I helped you find a place for the weapons, but you had to take care of the aftermath. You were forced to place the blame on Tetsuya's mother, as you once placed it on Hoshiguma.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1")]
[name="Mifune"]To you, the Kinsekikai is the King on the shogi board.
[name="Mifune"]You will preserve it at all costs, never hesitating to cut other pieces loose, be it a Queen like Hoshiguma, or Promoted Rooks like me that you look down on.
[name="Mifune"]I'm curious myself... what does Tetsuya mean to you?
[name="Mifune"]Is he a Rook? A Bishop? Or is he so incompetent that you see him as a Pawn you wouldn't mind losing?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#9$1")]
[name="Mifune"]If that was really so, we would have to have a fight here and now. But he isn't, is he?
[name="Mifune"]He is incompetent, but he's not a shogi piece. He's your precious son, not to be placed on the board—

[name="Mifune"]I'm not claiming strength in numbers, but the moment you swing Hannya at me, a button will be pressed, and these photos will show up on Kinseki Channel.
[name="Mifune"]And you'll be free, once and for all, when Tetsuya realizes that he was right, and his father never cared about him, just as his father never cared about his mother.

Tetsuya raises his bokutou again.
He charges at Mio in desperation, but is once again thrown easily to the floor.
Again, and again...
The TV set continues to mercilessly send distorted sounds into the room.
The sound of camera shutters, of people giving a show of applauding, of footsteps, of the rustling of pen on paper, of car doors shutting, of car engines rumbling.

The now-unfamiliar sound of the door to his father's manor.
Tetsuya has lost count of how many times he has gotten back up after being thrown to the ground by Mio. He charges futilely again, when he hears the voices behind him.
One, like a ghost; the other, like a man-eating Akki.
Voices that hardly even seem human anymore.
