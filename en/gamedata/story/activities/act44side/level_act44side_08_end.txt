She will strike back at any weapon that strikes at her.
More cries, the sound of weapons cutting through the night, discombobulated sounds that blend into a single lump in her chest, beating with her heart, pulsing—
Until it fully synchronizes with her heartbeat, drowning out all other sounds.
In the bloody haze, the vicious Oni keeps walking and killing, leaving behind a trail of blood and bodies, until she reaches the run-down shack and kicks the door open.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1044_hsgma2_1#7$2")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Where did your hatred come from?
[name="Hoshiguma"]I ran into Tetsuya at the TV station and heard from him what happened when Uncle Tessai died. You didn't have to be so cruel.
[name="Hoshiguma"]I don't know how he treated you all these years, but he must not have seen you as an adversary if you got as far as to turn him into a figurehead.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Beside, I didn't think I did you any wrong. When I came back to Mitsukue, all I wanted was to make sure that my sacrifice wasn't meaningless—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#9$1")]
[name="Mifune"]Sacrifice?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1")]
[name="Mifune"]That's why you make me sick, you and Tessai.
[name="Mifune"]You're a fool, and he's an even bigger fool. Even if you really did accidentally kill the candidate, did you think he wouldn't know to frame me for it, since I was there too?
[name="Mifune"]He favored you, so I kept waiting for the day when he would make me 'take responsibility' for the murder.
[name="Mifune"]It would have been the best result. He would protect his favorite, while eliminating a subordinate who had been going over his head.
[name="Mifune"]As for that little thing about killing one's brothers... what does it matter? Who would be foolish enough to speak up, with Hannya in your hand and his support behind you?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1044_hsgma2_1#7$2")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]......
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#2$1")]
[name="Mifune"]But he chose to cut ties with his favorite, choosing honor over family... how sickening.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1")]
[name="Mifune"]Did he really not know that the oyabun of the Kinsekikai was the furthest thing from 'honor', or did he just pretend not to know?
[name="Mifune"]Honor is a personal thing. When a group of people start acting in the name of honor, they'll either fall apart, or they're just dregs of society fooling themselves.
[name="Mifune"]Tessai always liked to boast, talking about how yakuza were pathetic outcasts that could only live under the protection of the syndicate.
[name="Mifune"]Retired veterans, hoodlums, gamblers, peddlers, orphans... Tessai united them under the banner of Kinsekikai, hoping they would love each other like family...
[name="Mifune"]Forget everything before that night for a moment and let's just talk about what happened after the diet candidate's death. Shimasu tried to blackmail me, Gouda tried to undermine me, and Sanoguchi tried to exclude me as he once excluded you...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1")]
[name="Mifune"]Family? Nothing more than old Tessai's pipe dream.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1044_hsgma2_1#7$2")]

[name="Mifune"]People starting to have designs on your burgeoning industry? Set your pride aside, and cling to the people who have the most use of you.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1")]
[name="Mifune"]Yes, I chose it. I let my own weakness shut my own mouth that night!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1044_hsgma2_1#7$2")]

[name="Mifune"]Guilty conscience?!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1")]
[name="Mifune"]Don't make me laugh, Officer Hoshiguma!
[name="Mifune"]The path I chose showed just how incompetent Tessai was, how hypocritical his honor was, and how close his Kinsekikai was to destruction!
[name="Mifune"]He was an incompetent, blind shogi player who began to abandon piece after piece for his precious Kinsekikai as changing times threatened to checkmate it.
[name="Mifune"]Your incident was just the beginning. The concept of 'Diet' had just emerged, and he had already abandoned you.
[name="Mifune"]When the relationship between North and South was at its most delicate, he was foolish enough to buy weapons from Northern Court factions, just to destroy a gang that was acting out of line in his eyes, one that had better weapons than the Kinsekikai.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#3$1")]
[name="Mifune"]He didn't even have that much of a grudge against them, other than the fact that they had once harbored the 'Wandering Vicious Oni' who killed his family.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#9$1")]
[name="Mifune"]Ostensibly, he was taking revenge for his wife and son. And look what came of it! He abandoned Tetsuya's mother and turned Tetsuya against him.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1")]
[name="Mifune"]As for me? How many times would he have abandoned me, but for the fact that this lieutenant of his never believed in this 'honor' of his for even a moment?
[name="Mifune"]I was proven right, time and again. He's no more than a Pawn who thinks himself a King, charging blindly into the fray...
[name="Mifune"]Did he think promotion awaited? No, everyone else, friend or foe, was walking in the opposite direction. There is nothing but a dead end awaiting him at the end of the road.
[name="Mifune"]To hold back the tide for that fool, clean up his mess, all the while getting walked all over by him?

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1044_hsgma2_1#4$2")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1044_hsgma2_1#2$2")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]I just don't know what to think anymore.
[name="Hoshiguma"]It was you who brought me back to Kajimachi. It was you who tried to make me lose my reason and eliminate me once and for all.
[name="Hoshiguma"]It was you who earned Tetsuya's fervent loyalty. It was you who made him witness his own father's death at your hands.
[name="Hoshiguma"]It was you who cut off your own finger in front of Uncle Tessai. It was you who cursed his incompetence, even unto his death.
[name="Hoshiguma"]Your analysis was very clear, very rational. I fully understood what you were saying, and how you got to this point.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1044_hsgma2_1#5$2")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1044_hsgma2_1#7$2")]

[name="Hoshiguma"]Uncle Tessai said you were faking it when you cut off your little finger that day in Kajimachi. I didn't believe it.
[name="Hoshiguma"]But now, I really want to know... how many fingers are there under your left glove?

The Phidia freezes.
He stares into Hoshiguma's eyes, as though waiting for her to avert her gaze.
Realizing that it is pointless, he snorts and displays his left hand in front of him, before slowly removing his glove.

Mifune says no more.
He pulls his long sword, which seems far too long for most men, but just right for him.
The blade is sharp as snow, but hidden in the night, as summer frost that should not be, that could fade away any moment.
[name="Mifune"]I had a thought, Hoshiguma.
That pompousness that had filled his voice up to this point is completely gone.
[name="Hoshiguma"]......
[name="Mifune"]When we were young, Tessai took us to watch the snow, here by this very riverside.
[name="Hoshiguma"]I remember.
[name="Mifune"]He said, don't look down on yourself just because you're yakuza.
[name="Mifune"]He said we're descendants of warriors. He said generations after generations of samurai since Shigekazu Onishoubu have given their lives for loyalty and righteousness, and we are their legacy.

Opposite him, the blue flames of rage burn brightly around Hoshiguma.
No longer does it burn for Kinbee, but bright it burns, almost burning through the brightly suffocating night of Mitsukue—

The two stand with their backs towards each other, having swapped places in the exchange.
Hoshiguma returns her sword to its sheath.
Kinbee's figure drops lower and lower, until he falls to the ground, no longer able to stand.

Hoshiguma turns and walks towards the ruins of Kajimachi.
Lying on the ground, Kinbee casts his eyes towards the other side of the river, as he feels the cold of his own blood leaving his body.
The noise and commotion look down coldly on the empty shores on this side, which will soon become much shinier and brighter.

The one-horned Oni walks past the ruins of old buildings, past the indifferent bustle of the entertainment district, past the foe who had crossed swords with her a moment ago, and into the glaring dark night.
A cool breeze blows from behind, bringing fresh liberation, and sounds that do not belong to the present.
Going to the summer fair with her father, and the unscrupulous yatai owner giving her a net made of the flimsiest paper for scooping fins.
That summer night after her father's passing, she licked the apple candy Tessai gave her that did not seem right for her age.
The throwing rings that seemed too juvenile for her, but which could never seem to hit their mark, as though they were imbued with some sort of Arts.
Going to the shooting stall with a 'Holy City of Laterano' sign that only had cheap stuff, after getting drunk with her Kinsekikai brothers...
She takes one step after another towards these scenes of Higashinese summer nights.
But they are ghosts of the past, brushing by her, fading into the distance like the one she has defeated...
And the fireworks.
Yes, the fireworks of Higashi's summer nights, which she may never have a chance to see again.
