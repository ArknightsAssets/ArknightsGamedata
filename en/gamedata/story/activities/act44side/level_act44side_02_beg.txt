The recycler pulls out his terminal and begins dispatching vehicles and personnel, while Tessai and Hoshiguma remain standing by the trash heap. Neither of them appears ready to leave.
The evening air is thick and humid. As Hoshiguma looks at the trash heap, her thoughts return to Lungmen.
If it was Missy standing here with me, she would've already dragged me back to her place by now, she thinks.
And if it was Ch'en Hui-chieh, she would've rolled up her sleeves, without saying a word, and started hauling trash from the basement and second floor.
If it was 'Lin Gray' or his daughter... I mean, they would never have even let the house become haunted in the first place.
The old man beside her remains silent. The garbage truck arrives, gets loaded up with trash, and then rumbles away.

As Tessai slowly walks away, Hoshiguma turns her gaze to the empty backyard.
When her father died, Mitsukue still hadn't completely recovered from the chaos of the Bloodpeak Campaign.
In accordance with the old customs, she had her father cremated. She buried his ashes in the backyard. Also, she erected a marker, made of the finest wood, and implored Tessai to carve the inscription.
When she came to clean out the backyard, all these years later, she found the wooden marker was still standing firm, even amidst all the garbage. She's been so busy cleaning up that she hasn't had time to tend to the grave yet.

[name="Slick Reporter"]After twenty years, the legendary Ao-Oni of Kinsekikai, has returned! We caught a glimpse of her yesterday at the concert on Nita Street, and now she stands here before us!
[name="Slick Reporter"]Is she a master mimic? A ghost wandering this mortal coil? A cold-blooded killer who's been silently stalking Mitsukue for twenty years, leaving a trail of bodies in her wake?

Before the reporter finishes speaking, Hoshiguma turns around and begins walking toward the house, only to bump into another hurried reporter.
More and more reporters gather round, like Originium slugs that have smelled leftover food in the sewer.
