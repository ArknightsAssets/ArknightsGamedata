The abandoned house in the alley at the end of Kajimachi's North Street... everyone calls it the 'Haunted House'.
After the vicious Oni disappeared, Shimasu, who was the shateigashira, moved into the house with his family, but within three months, he fell ill and passed away.
Six months later, Sanoguchi, who was then serving as wakagashira-hosa, bought the house. After hiring an onmyoji to perform rites for seven days and nights, he moved in with his new bride.
On the seventh night, a patrolman heard wretched wails coming from the 'Haunted House'. In a fit of madness, Sanoguchi took up his family's heirloom blade, killed his wife, and then took his own life.
In the years that followed, every soul who deigned to live in the Haunted House met a terrible end. Eventually, no one dared go near it again.
[name="Momoka"]Legend has it that the vicious Oni never really disappeared. From time to time, her tortured visage will pop up in the Haunted House.
