Following Momoka to the window, Hoshiguma sees the objects lined up on it, and...
A flowerpot.
There is only the stem of a plant left; the upper half has been severed.
Hoshiguma turns her head towards the trash can, and sees the upper half lying inside.

[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
For some reason, Momoka seems to get angrier with each word that Hoshiguma says.
Her eyes are wide. She is panting hard, and trembling all over, seemingly willing to fight to the death.
Hoshiguma instinctively takes a step back and even has the urge to gulp, something that she does not often do. Not that Momoka is trying to do anything to her, but...
Momoka intends to kill. Hoshiguma can sense it.
Hoshiguma takes another step back and touches a water bottle. She immediately pours a cup of water and hands it to Momoka.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_136_hsguma_1#2$1")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Here, have some water.
[charslot]
[playsound(key="$d_avg_drinkswllw")]
Momoka does not answer. She snatches the cup out of Hoshiguma's hands and empties it in a single gulp, leaving bite marks on the edge of the paper cup.
At least it seems to have calmed her down a little... if only a little.

Momoka takes a big step towards Hoshiguma. Hoshiguma almost knocks over the water bottle as she flinches.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#15$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#15$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#16$1")]
[name="Momoka"]But I have to do overtime when the agency asks. I don't get home until 3 or 4 in the morning, and a lot of times I don't even remember when I last watered it.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#17$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#15$1")]
[name="Momoka"]But the people at the agency laugh at me when I say I want to take Hasuke with me on long trips!
[name="Momoka"]I tried those blogger tips and put eyedrop vials in the soil, but it doesn't work. Hasuke's leaves are always yellow when I come back from a long trip, and it almost wilted a few times!

[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_136_hsguma_1#2$1")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]Is it... a gift from someone dear to you?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#21$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#21$1")]
[name="Momoka"]I came to Mitsukue with Hanamaru, a cloudbeast I had kept for a long time.
[name="Momoka"]As my work got busier, I no longer had time to care for her, so I gave her away along with her climbing rack. I bought a similar one to remember her.
[name="Momoka"]I knew I didn't have time to keep a pet, so I thought I would keep a plant.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_136_hsguma_1#2$1")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]And that was Hasuke?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#1$1")]
[name="Momoka"]No, my first one was Ran.
[name="Momoka"]I tried my best to make time to take care of Ran, following the instructions in the manual to the letter, but after a few months...

Hoshiguma glances at the flowerpot next to the cloudbeast climbing rack.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#1$1")]
[name="Momoka"]A little seedling sprouted in Ran's pot. I asked the flower shop owner and he said it was a berry seedling, and suggested that I changed pots. That was Ichigo.

[name="Momoka"]But I would come home to an empty room, without even a single blade of grass I could talk to without putting on a mask... I couldn't take it anymore, which was why I got Tamasaburou.

With tears in her eyes, Momoka walks from one end of the window sill to the other, showing them to Hoshiguma one by one. Hoshiguma is not sure whether to laugh or cry, until Momoka pulls the last bag open.
It is not a memorial for a pet or plant, but two memorial tablets. The names inscribed upon them are 'Kazuhiko Shino' and 'Kumiko Shino'.

[name="Momoka"]Waste from the factories had polluted the water supply. People didn't know they were drinking polluted water until a few years before I was born.
[name="Momoka"]I managed to grow up pretty healthy, but my parents were not so lucky.
[name="Momoka"]Papa died when I was very little, around five or six years old. I was brought up by my mother.
[name="Momoka"]I don't remember much about Papa. As for Mama... she was never in good health. She complained about not being able to see clearly, feeling numb in her hands and feet, and was also prone to falling.
[name="Momoka"]The Kaneshiro clan hushed things up, giving people with clear health problems a pittance, while finding all sort of excuses to deny relief to people who could still take care of themselves.
[name="Momoka"]Mama's condition had really deteriorated by the time Kinbee's agency scouted me, partly by persuasion and partly by coercion. She passed away not long after my debut.
[name="Momoka"]I wanted to attend her funeral, but the agency wouldn't let me, because I had become somewhat well-known by then, and they didn't want people to know that I came from Gokawa.
[name="Momoka"]They gave me the surname name 'Hanyuu', which sounds northern, because the surname 'Shino' might clue people in on where I came from.
[name="Momoka"]My relatives took care of the funeral, but the agency prohibited me from telling them the true reason why I couldn't go back.
[name="Momoka"]They cut ties with me after sending Mama's spirit tablet and ashes to me.
[name="Momoka"]The agency told me the best way to comfort my parents' souls was to become a star.
[name="Momoka"]Like force-feeding a fowlbeast, they kept telling me to become the biggest star in Mitsukue, in Higashi, on Terra, that it was the meaning of my entire existence.
[name="Momoka"]And so I kept walking down this path, forcing myself to believe that they were right, until a few days ago.
[name="Momoka"]My performing career was the entirety of my life. Anything that could help my career, I had to do, no matter how unwilling I was. Anything that could hurt my career, I couldn't touch, no matter how attractive it was.
