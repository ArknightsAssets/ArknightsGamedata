Shockingly, the room past the door holds no confidential documents or precious metals.
Bereft of even entertainment facilities, it merely looks like a simple, sloppy room of a local.
Other than the old pachinko machine in the center of the room.
Having escaped destruction in Kajimachi, it is now connected to a dedicated circuit, emitting light and distorted music.
The diet member, who appeared quite dignified earlier, is jumping at the chance to have a try at the machine.
He lifts a huge basket of pachinko balls from the ground. Right before he inserts them into the machine, a voice sounds from behind it.
[name="Voice of a Kami"]Got your wish?
[name="Diet Member"]Yes, yes. Kami-sama, thank you for your blessings! I am finally content!
[name="Diet Member"]Thank you for showing up at my humble home after so long!
[name="Diet Member"]You stayed with me for so many years, but suddenly vanished the other day, and I was so worried! I thought you had abandoned me! Ah, happy returns!

[name="Diet Member"]Hah, I don't believe you. Think about it, what sort of loser was I back then? A jobless hikkikomori unwilling to study or work... to borrow a trendy word of today—ah yes, a NEET.
[name="Diet Member"]Every day I begged my mother for coin to get a few pachinko rounds in. If I won, I'd consider myself lucky that day, or unlucky otherwise.
[name="Diet Member"]But that day, that day my destiny changed—I saw you on the streets.
[name="Diet Member"]I got nothing but wins that day. The pachinko balls flowed freely like water, and I even ran out of trays to carry them all!
[charslot(slot = "m", focus="m")]
[name="Kami of Happy Returns"]And then?
[charslot(slot = "m", focus="n")]
[name="Diet Member"]Then?
[name="Diet Member"]Then I won a fortune 'big' enough to start a business on Nita Street. They were just pachinko balls after all. There was no way I could win more than the house.
[name="Diet Member"]But you showed up, and it proved to me... I was no longer a loser.
[name="Diet Member"]From that day on I believed strongly, I was blessed with fortune by you... looked after by a kami.
[name="Diet Member"]Had I not gotten blessed by you, how could I have won so much at pachinko, and used the earnings to speculate and profit till today?
[charslot(slot = "m", focus="m")]
[name="Kami of Happy Returns"]I blessed you?

[name="Diet Member"]But I couldn't give the order directly, so I said, take over Kajimachi, come up with a redevelopment plan, and bring back this pachinko machine on the way back, because I have ties to it.
[name="Diet Member"]And then everything went to shit. The Kajimachi gangs, the Lungmen cop, and even Kinbee's own artist... what a mess it was. The machine was almost lost to the chaos too.
[name="Diet Member"]<i>Fuzakeru na,</i> if something happened to this machine you blessed, then what point is there turning that piece of rotten land by the river into Mitsukue's commercial center?
[name="Kami of Happy Returns"]......
[name="Diet Member"]It's not just me, but the whole of Mitsukue too... all of Southern Court is under your watch, which is why we're developing so fast and how our property prices are soaring, right?
[name="Diet Member"]The Northern Court bumpkins are scrunching up their faces in anger, but they can't do anything about the fact you don't want to go over there.
[name="Diet Member"]With you watching over us, we will surely improve, for...
A drop of sweat slides down his face. Not from nervousness, but his passion has gotten him heated up.
[name="Diet Member"]For... eternity!
And the kami looks down at him from the top of the machine...
Down at this secretly purchased thirty-floor high luxury apartment, with VIP-exclusive elevators...
Down at the almost hundred-meter high building, down at the clamor and chaos of Mitsukue...
And then It speaks a line It was tired of repeating, yet rarely taken seriously.

[name="Male Ægir"]Now then. Allow me to once again apologize to you and the Kanou clan on behalf of the Nishigori clan. We are extremely sorry for the trouble caused by our failure to discipline our younger generation.
[name="Female Elafia"]Please, there is no need to exaggerate. The important issues are all settled, and I would like to thank your daughter for providing this opportunity for us to hold this discussion in person.
[name="Female Elafia"]Mitsukue has an incompetent diet member who allows violent gangs to run rampant, and your daughter merely acted in the name of justice. What wrong has she committed?

Sarasa freezes on the spot, her flushed cheeks from the joy of having gotten herself out of trouble turning pale.
She raises her head to look up at the little patch of sky encircled by the shrine, closes her eyes, and clenches her fists in a position where she believes her father cannot see...
Then, she puts on an obedient and emotionless expression as she follows her father's steps out of the shrine grounds.
