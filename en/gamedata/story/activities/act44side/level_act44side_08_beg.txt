Tetsuya is lying on the ground next to Mifune, wounded but alive.
It is not that the Phidia intended to spare him.
Indeed, Mifune wanted to put an end to this quickly many times, only to be forced back by the suicidal attacks of the young Oni, who seemed to be intentionally aiming himself at the tip of Mifune's sword, just to find a chance to take Mifune down with him.
Momoka's speech coming through the screen beside him only served as a further distraction, and his trembling hands repeatedly missed their mark.
Even as Mifune changed his goal from killing to incapacitation, and then to simply shaking off this maniac in order to deal with the fallout, Tetsuya kept getting up from the ground, in spite of all his injuries.
Meanwhile, Momoka's speech is drawing to a close.

The novice ninja taunts Momoka, but he keeps his gaze fixed on her eyes.
A cornered beast will fight back, and the same is true for the girl in front of him. What kind of Arts will she use? Mist? A high-pressure jet? Acid spray, even?
He must not let his guard down just because he is facing an idol with no combat experience.
It is unlikely that her Arts would be particularly powerful, and there would be little movement from her microphone-shaped Arts unit when she casts. Better to stay focused on her eyes.
Her eyes will betray all that she is thinking.
For example... murderous intent.
Foolish girl, not knowing her place.
But that is all. Observe her eyes, and analyze her intent, be it the timing of casting, direction, or...
Why is there no intent other than murder?
