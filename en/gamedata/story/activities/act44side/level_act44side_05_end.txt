[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]But my favorite version is cruel... and beautiful.
[name="Mifune"]Before he reached nirvana and entered Kaśjñāna, Qui'lon heard the cries of the last Oni when they were forced to become people of Ashihara.
[name="Mifune"]By then, however, Qui'lon no longer had the strength to leave Ashoka, nor wield a sword to save his people, or even keep his fiery blue wrath in check—

[name="Mifune"]The flames of rage took over Qui'lon's soul. He lost all reason, and in his mad rampage destroyed an entire army even as he lay at the gates of death, but the kin whom he was trying to protect were also destroyed by his sword.
[name="Mifune"]It is unknown whether Qui'lon died of exhaustion, or took his own life, or whether he was so heartless that he attained nirvana, fully at peace with himself, in spite of what he did.

Many a sunset has he watched lying on this rooftop, watching the sky turn from red to black, until the stars appear, before their light is overcome by the neon city.
The hour is early, and the sky should not look like dusk, but he pays little heed. Perhaps he considers it a sign of the coming of a kami.
He could not describe his own emotions as he gazes at the sky.
Excitement? Anxiety? Fulfillment? Emptiness? Sadness?
But he lies there, waiting for a guest who may never come...
Until the warm breeze sends him into slumber.
