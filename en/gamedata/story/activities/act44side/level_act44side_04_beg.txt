[name="Mio"]Our Diet Member has finally approved the separation of the Kinseki Group from the Kinsekikai.
[name="Mio"]As long as you now accept the role of chairman, the Kinseki Group and the Kinsekikai can go their separate ways.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]Yes.
[name="Mifune"]I saw your brow twitch. I know what you're thinking. You know I don't joke about things like this, yet you still don't believe me. Basically, you think that...
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]I shouldn't have forced you to forge a letter in the Old Man's name, and that calling Hoshiguma back here did nothing but cause trouble for everyone... is that it?

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]Twenty years ago... Hoshiguma... and that shield of hers... spilled quite a bit of blood. After all, it was the last thing the Old Man forged... Mio, have you ever been to his home?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1901_1#13$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mio"]Yes, many years ago.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]What is his house full of?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1901_1#13$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mio"]Televisions.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]That's right, televisions.
[name="Mifune"]The Old Man might be stubborn, but his instincts are still sharp, some of the time.
[name="Mifune"]He knew that if the Kinsekikai continued their unending torrent of bloodshed, we were bound to be destroyed sooner or later. So he set his sights on Originium crystalline components.
[name="Mifune"]He quickly converted his metalworking shop into a workshop for crystalline components, and it was an instant success. After that, the Old Man no longer had time to forge the legendary weapons he loved most.
[name="Mifune"]Just as his crystal business was really taking off, the Old Man suddenly acquired the materials, and techniques, to forge shields from a fallen noble house of the Mitsumoto faction.
[name="Mifune"]They say that he spent nearly half of the Group's liquid assets to acquire them.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]That shield, the last shield the old man ever forged, the shield he had spent so many assets to acquire... do you ever think it might have had some special significance to the Kinsekikai?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1901_1#13$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mio"]The transition to a new leader.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]Even you knew that... but the Old Man just let the matter sit there. He kept putting it off and putting it off, all the way until the Southern Court was about to hold the first meeting of its Diet.
[name="Mifune"]You young ones grew up with the Diet, but back in my day, no one even knew what it was.
[name="Mifune"]We thought the Diet was going to revamp the bureaucracy as soon as they took office, but it took them a few years to get around to it.
[name="Mifune"]Back then, all we'd heard was that the members of the Diet were to be chosen from among the commoners. The entire Southern Court was in an uproar, and then that poor fool, Koretou, emerged.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1901_1#13$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mio"]The candidate?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]Yes. He had a whole heap of political views, but his core aim was to drive us, the Kinsekikai, out of Kajimachi.
[name="Mifune"]He roused a bunch of useless rabble and had them shouting and yelling outside Kajimachi all day and night. It made it impossible for us to do business.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]The Old Man, no... not just him, the whole Kinsekikai didn't take Koretou seriously at first, but every day, he recruited more and more troublemakers.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1901_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mio"]So... you decided to get rid of him.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]Yes, and you know the rest of the story, of course. After Koretou died, the Kinsekikai learned what real public fury looks like.
[name="Mifune"]That was also when I learned that to the Four Great Clans, the members of the Diet are nothing but stage props...
[name="Mifune"]But to us... they're people who can decide our fate with a single word.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1901_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mio"]With all due respect, you could just come out and say it: if Chairman Tessai refuses to yield, you'll need Hannya at the succession ceremony.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]I say, sometimes you really do sound just like him.
[name="Mifune"]Of course, Tessai lording it over me is one thing. Hearing it from someone as steadfast and frank as you is another thing entirely.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]In truth, once the Kinseki Group splits from the Kinsekikai, I obviously can't stay on as chairman. Is there anyone else, besides you, who can take my place?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1901_1#13$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mio"]......
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#9$1",focus="l")]

Mifune bursts out laughing to himself.
The woman before him remains expressionless. Is it habitual impassivity, incredulity, or mere indifference to Mifune's grand vision? There's no way to tell.

[name="Mifune"]For now, Momoka is still our top priority.
[name="Mifune"]She knows too much, and she's in cahoots with that information broker.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]She even leapt out a window just to keep Sanoguchi's broken blade on her. Don't you understand what that means?

[name="Mio"]Mifune-san——
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]You were too kind-hearted to kill her, and you were willing to admit that to me. That's good. I can promise you this much: we can reconsider our plan to infect her with Oripathy.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]First, however, you must bring her to me.
[name="Mifune"]That broken blade she's carrying.... we must recover its guard, no matter the cost.
[name="Mifune"]Secondly, there's no way she can continue her career as an entertainer. From now on, she'll have to remain firmly under our control.
[name="Mifune"]Are you okay with that?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1901_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mio"]You are most magnanimous.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1896_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Mifune"]No. When you bring her here, she should be the one thanking you.

The sun slowly climbs overhead.
Although no other visitors are present, the garden no longer seems so empty and quiet, with four humans and a kami walking through it.
Kichisei begins thrusting forward anything and everything she has that a woman could conceivably scrawl a signature on. Startled by the sudden barrage, Momoka keeps her autographing hand moving without pause.

[name="Nosy Kami"]I'm telling you, being a kami is a job that depends entirely on the whims of fate.
[name="Nosy Kami"]This Kizuna Jinja is about bringing people together. Most of you spend your whole lives dealing with other people, and there's probably nothing more important than the bonds you form, don't you think?
[name="Nosy Kami"]When times are stable, people pray for their existing bonds to last. When times are turbulent, they pray for these bonds to carry them through—or for new ones to form.
[name="Nosy Kami"]But over the past decade or so, fewer and fewer people have come here. These days, on our best days, we only get a dozen or so visitors.

[name="Momoka"]A Kinsekikai guy was tailing her. She also said the area around the shrine might not be safe, she saw people sneaking around when she stepped out through the shrine gate.

[name="Unruffled Priest"]The next time you see Kichisei, please thank her for me.
[name="Unruffled Priest"]You really don't need to be too worried. Whether or not the yakuza are running around Mitsukue, even if they dare invade the shrine, they're just causing themselves trouble.
[name="Unruffled Priest"]If you need to take shelter within the shrine grounds, you can head inside. I'll handle everything else. If you'd rather leave, I'll show you the way out. Take the side path.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_136_hsguma_1#7$1")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]I think we'd better leave. The longer we stay here, the more men they can deploy around here to get us.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1904_1#1$2")]
[name="Nosy Kami"]That's pretty much the idea. Playing those slow-witted yakuza fools every now and then, well, it's not as thrilling as chasing kaidan, but it does pass the time.
[name="Nosy Kami"]I'll make a break through the front gate first to distract the dumb yakuza goons. You all slip out the back and we'll rendezvous at that moron's yatai.

Gleaming fire gushes from the wide sleeves of his robe, like streams of spring water—neither surging nor even trembling—only drifting quietly through the air, until a gust of wind sweeps through from the shrine gate.
It is a cruel wind, sharp as a knife, the kind no kami would raise in idle sport with humankind.
Seeing the faint foxfire flare up in the rear courtyard, the kami at the shrine gate lets go of the handlebars and rises to its feet. With a trace of pride, it lifts a forepaw and sweeps it through the air—

The crystalline flames burst like exorcising thunder, and the shimenawa hung around the shrine instantly ignite with foxfire, severing the mortal world from the divine realm.
The fierce wind erupts along the edge of the divine realm, tearing away every camera, drone, and listening device, along with their camouflage, and hurling them into the air.

The gohei slices into the wind and shears apart the surging foxfire. The wind strips the casings off the surveillance equipment, while the flames shoot through each newly exposed core with perfect precision.

The surveillance equipment ignites with brilliant, silent white flames; a moment later, bursts apart and falls to the ground as bits of scorched charcoal.
