Mio once again prepares to attack.

Moriuchi swings his entire body to throw Hannya in the direction of the standoff.
Mio's ethereal hand is the first to catch Hannya's handle, but Hoshiguma leaps and spins one hundred and eighty degrees like she is dancing, forcing the ethereal hand to loosen its grip, allowing her to take Hannya's handle.

Rage.
The rage that seemed compressed around Hoshiguma now spreads outwards, burning on her arms, her shield, and her sword.
Hoshiguma takes a step forward, and the flames of rage almost catch the hem of Mio's clothing.

Hoshiguma shifts her posture to one that makes it easy to unleash her power. The blue flames continue to burn intermittently around her.
The face of Hannya glares with wide-open eyes on the face of the shield. The edge of the sword seems ready to seep blue blood—
