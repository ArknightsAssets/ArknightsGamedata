Moriuchi feels a chill come over him, as though the setting sun is suffocating in its own golden rays.
Is this really the Kami that he encountered when he was young?
Or is this simply an absurd nightmare... no, something trying to deceive him and make him abandon his search for the kami?
But Its mannerisms, the way It talks, even the line 'What does any of that have to do with me?'... he has never forgotten them.
In Moriuchi's memory, even those cold words seemed to be a kind of encouragement. Now, though...
Moriuchi is gasping for air, but the cold nightmare seems inexorably suffocating.
He reaches into his pocket and takes out the key.

Moriuchi raises the keys and takes off the maneki-neko accessory.
He looks at the keychain, as though he is talking to the kami behind it.
[name="Moriuchi"]But I wanted a friend. A true friend.
[name="Moriuchi"]Can you understand that? Would it make you... angry?
[name="Kami of Happy Returns"]......
[name="Moriuchi"]If you're not angry... might I be so presumptuous as to... make a bet with you?
Moriuchi stretches out his hand, into the sky unobstructed by concrete.
[name="Moriuchi"]If I do as you say...
[name="Moriuchi"]I'll never have a true friend for the rest of my life...
[name="Moriuchi"]I'll never have true happiness.
He bites his lip and opens up his trembling hand.

The accessory falls straight down, like any ordinary object, and is soon swallowed by the dark streets beneath the setting sun.

Moriuchi turns around to see nothing, as though nothing was there to begin with, except for the orange-yellow glow of dusk.
He turns his head to the front, and sees the Nosy Kami floating in the air in front.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1904_1#1$2")]
[name="Nosy Kami"]That neko left because you rejected It. Does that surprise you?

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1904_1#1$2")]
[name="Nosy Kami"]It's not me who wanted to help you. The star of our shrine told me to help you if I have time, for all the chikuwa offerings you made.

[name="Nosy Kami"]Don't expect me to help you fight. I'm just pointing the way.
[name="Nosy Kami"]After all, both of us have a score to settle with that bastard Mifune.
