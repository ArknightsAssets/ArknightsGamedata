One side of the pond lies a small unicycle leaning against a rock, pedals still moving on their own.
The thing on the unicycle appears before her, with a cycling helmet fitted perfectly on Its head. It's bright round eyes stare somewhat helplessly at all the water dripping to the floor.
Beside her, Hoshiguma's expression softens after making sure she's alright.
She nods in greeting to the person behind her, who Momoka guesses is Kichisei, then turns to look into the distance...

[name="???"]Besides, it was just a round of hide-and-seek. Why were you going at it so seriously?
[name="Momoka"]S-Seriously?
[name="???"]You looked like your life was on the line when you went into the pond with me.
[name="???"]Same goes for Moriuchi too. A kami I may be, but what makes him so sure a random god he finds on the streets is bound to be his maneki-neko?
[name="Kichisei"]Momoka, do you want me to lure the priest away? Or—
[name="Momoka"]No, it's alright. The person we're looking for—no, the 'kami' we're looking for is right here.
[name="Nosy Kami"]Relax, I'm already right before your eyes. No more running for me.
[name="Nosy Kami"]I'll watch over you, and no one on the shrine grounds will cause you any trouble. Soak in the pond for as long as you like.
Momoka carefully places a hand on the kami, and this time It no longer dodges her. Although It fidgets to her touch, but It seems to at least hold no objections to mortal contact.
The cool breeze drags slowly across the pond, as if all that running and chasing that happened before dawn was merely a strange and messy, but not terrifying dream.
