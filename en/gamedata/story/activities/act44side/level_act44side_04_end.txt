[name="Moriuchi"]The old building behind the police station on Doku Street. The 'cursed elevator'.

[name="Moriuchi"]Sometimes the maneki-neko in the lobby, which is normally fixed to the front desk, just vanishes, only to reappear the next day. This seems to be correlated to when the sixteenth floor appears.
[name="Moriuchi"]The phenomenon isn't limited to the old building. Many others have told me that their maneki-nekos disappear and reappear at odd times.

[name="Nosy Kami"]Besides, I've also explored that old building pretty carefully.
[name="Nosy Kami"]First, there's no hidden button. The button for the sixteenth floor is right above the button for the fifteenth floor. It's just covered by a steel plate.
[name="Nosy Kami"]Kami didn't do that, and no human could lift that steel plate.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4199_makiri_1#11$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1904_1#1$2")]
[name="Nosy Kami"]See, even you think it's silly, right?

[name="Nosy Kami"]Then the receptionist started answering the phone, a long string of calls, and kept apologizing and stuff. That was it.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4199_makiri_1#9$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1904_1#1$2")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1904_1#1$2")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#3$1")]
[name="Momoka"]No. But when a variety show came to film here, one of my coworkers floated that idea, only to get an earful from the producer at our agency.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4199_makiri_1#11$1")]
[name="Moriuchi"]He chewed him out?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#6$1")]
[name="Momoka"]The producer went on about a bunch of stuff I barely understood, something about a 'Tekkaba' being a Kinsekikai business. I guess it's some kind of restaurant, and they didn't want a TV show hurting their business.
[dialog]
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_136_hsguma_1#5$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4199_makiri_1#8$1")]
[name="Moriuchi"]Tekkaba?!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1918_1#3$1")]
[name="Momoka"]Yes. What's wrong? 'Tekka' is the name of a Higashinese finbeast dish, so wouldn't 'Tekkaba' just be a restaurant that sells 'Tekka'?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_136_hsguma_1#2$1")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]'Tekkaba' is a code word for 'casino'.
[name="Hoshiguma"]So I guess 'hell' is just a Kinsekikai casino, and anyone who wanders in there by mistake is made to keep their mouth shut.
[name="Hoshiguma"]The button for the sixteenth floor has to be triggered by some kind of mechanism. It probably leads to a hidden mezzanine—or maybe even a basement.
[name="Hoshiguma"]That maneki-neko is probably some kind of signaling device. Press it, and it sends a message. That's why after our dear kami-sama pressed it, the receptionist apologized to them.
[charslot]
Momoka lets out a sigh. It's hard to tell whether it's out of pity for Moriuchi or out of relief that there isn't a real kaidan.
The Nosy Kami scratches Its head in mild irritation. It clearly wasn't expecting the kaidan tale to end like this.

[name="Moriuchi"]After the restaurant was torn down a couple of years ago, people would sometimes say they caught the scent of fried food drifting through the area. Other people even claimed they could sometimes see the diner still standing on the empty lot. Only they could never get close to it.

Hoshiguma plants a foot on the flash drive she's just blocked. It gives a sharp electronic whine, then bursts apart with a loud pop.

The two ninjas exchange a glance. One draws a short blade, the other a long sword, and together they lunge at Momoka from opposite sides.

Hannya spins in Hoshiguma's hands, a blazing circle of fury. The long sword's edge strikes it and buckles, shattering to pieces. The ninja with the dagger dives to the ground, dodging the whirling shield before it can shred limbs.
Only then does the third figure, hidden all this time in the shadows, appear—sending a cluster of flash drives silently hurtling toward Hoshiguma's unprotected head.
It's too late to call out a warning, so Momoka leaps to her feet, trying to imitate a movie scene. She swings her shoulder bag in an attempt to bat the little drives back.

Hoshiguma charges the nearest ninja head-on. The black-clad assassin slams into the shield, snapping many ribs.
She is about to break through the encirclement when her shoulder suddenly feels light. Something has yanked Moriuchi up into the air.

Hannya slices through the rope attached to the grappling hook. Momoka drops safely into Hoshiguma's arms, while the oden yatai owner is flung by the momentum and lands in a heap in front of his own cart.
