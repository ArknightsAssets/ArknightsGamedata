As the visitors ascend into the sky and enter the Tomb of Sui, they seem to have forgotten something while rejoicing in their unprecedented achievement—
One can enter the depths of the Garden of Grotesqueries by substituting heaven and earth with material objects to scale the mountain and conduct the Placation.
But the visitors cannot answer why the mausoleum is opened with a giant weiqi board and painted blocks of type.
Perhaps it is this recklessness and ignorance that angers the Sui proxy.
And so, through every carefully calculated sword strike and thunderclap by the visitors, the proxy known for strategy nonetheless shakes up this false realm.
Weiqi stones fall from the sky as type blocks rise from the ground, as if to sandwich all beings in-between to fine dust.
The moment heaven and earth coalesce, a cyan scroll whisks the visitors away.

Liang gently places the frightened and confused crowd in the open space before the memorial hall.
After calming them and handing over the seal, Liang gestures to Yi then escorts the group down the mountain, answering their incessant questions as they go.

Yi waits for the all-too curious visitors to vanish from his sight before he looks towards the memorial hall.
The guests have just left, but a rare guest has arrived.

Inside, another Sui proxy stands alone.
Is that him in the flesh? Or one of his clones? It doesn't even matter anymore...
Wang needs a little time to process this reunion after a hundred and twenty years.

Her name has faded from her portrait, but her expression remains serene as ever.
Be it the face in his memories, or the presence felt inside the Tomb of Sui, they impart the same hope—
Educate and expound, her life's work to last for a millennium.
She has always been brimming with expectations for this great land.

This is Wang's first visit to the memorial hall.
In the past hundred and twenty years, he has been repeatedly chewing on his guilt, regret, and rancor...
He hates everything that buried her here, himself included.
He never dared to enter this place.
Until today, when that group of hot-headed visitors spread out the weiqi pieces and the characters before him...
[name="Yi"]You believed they could bring her back, so why drive them away?
[name="Wang"]I should have left them there to rot for their reckless behavior.
[name="Yi"]...But?
[name="Wang"]......
Wang does not speak, and there is no need for him to. This is the first time in all these years someone has brought back that ink stick from their boundless history.
All he needs is to find that trace of ink within the Feranmut's memories...
With ink, words can form, and they can restore her.
Can he hope for that? Should he believe in it?

Yi extends his hand in an asking gesture. He smiles with optimism under his elder brother's stern gaze.
Wang falls silent again for a long time...
The past drifts in like clouds, and he finally decides.
The weiqi board and character blocks merge into a wordless scroll in his hands, and he turns around sharply—

The empty scroll floats onto Wang's back, like a pair of open arms.
Within the painting remains a gentle smile.
Wang hands the scroll over to Yi.
[name="Wang"]...I'll leave it to you.
[name="Yi"]I'll do all I can.

Paper carries ink, ink turns into words.
After years apart, perhaps... they can meet again?
