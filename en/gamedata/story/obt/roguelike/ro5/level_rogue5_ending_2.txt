Zuo Le has never in his life imagined he would manage to challenge a Feranmut.
But now, it seems to be his reality.
[Dialog]
[Delay(time=1)]
The bestial Sui leaves the summit where they were, rolling and twisting in the sky.
He remembers how ancient texts he read spoke of how when 'gods' die, heaven and earth distort, flooding the realm with calamity as the land mourns.
But now, the Feranmut—
Is turning into a scroll?
His eyes open wide.
The bestial Sui's fins turn into scraps of paper as they fall, exposing flesh and blood, like a thick tome opened.
Pages helplessly cling onto the beast until the words written upon are flung into the air, vanishing into the wind.
A fatal wound now devoid of cover now stands starkly for all to see.

That is Its heart.
It turns out the bestial Sui has a beating heart just like we do.
The heart glows like the sun, emanating warmth.
It beats slowly, calmly, compared to the bestial body struggling about.
Like a woman deep in slumber, silently waiting for her end.

...Wait!
Zuo Le rubs his eyes, and looks carefully at the 'heart'.
He is sure of what he sees—
A young lady curled up within, horns above and tail below, her hands patterned in brown.
Her mouth is moving. What is she saying? What does she want to tell us?
Characters, words that were forgotten? The truth from a century ago? Or the original end of this bestial Sui?
[stopmusic(fadetime=1)]
No, that's not it. This is not 'Sui'!
Those eyes, horns, and tail!
This... this is!

Zuo Le turns around to look at the memorial hall with its open doors.
He looks past the Sui proxy fiddling with a jade rule from his sleeve, and seems to spot the inkstick received from the visitors, now placed on an altar.
Above the altar appears to be a indistinct portrait.

After the guests are far gone, Yi lets out an almost inaudible sigh, tapping a jade rule on his palm.
