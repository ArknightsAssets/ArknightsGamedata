[name="Liang"]Thank you for coming, everyone. Follow me, the entrance is just up ahead.

[name="Lin Qingyan"]So this is where the Placation is held? It seems no different from any ordinary garden... What is there to stop ordinary civilians from accidentally trespassing onto the grounds?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1870_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Liang"]Yi selected this spot precisely because he originally planned to create an ordinary garden here.
[name="Liang"]Anyone with no connection to the Sui will only see an ordinary garden, and those with no taste for elegance will never find the place at all.

[name="Zuo Le"]The Sui Regulator has kept strict surveillance over this mountain for years, and my colleagues have tried their best to rein in the Sui's influence.
[name="Zuo Le"]From the foot of the mountain to the memorial hall on the summit serves as a path for us Candleholders to hone our skills.
[name="Zuo Le"]Though it's safe here at the base, and many come by to enjoy the view, the environment turns more and more erratic the higher you go.
[name="Zuo Le"]Only the most learned and adaptable Candleholders will manage to scale the mountain, complete the ceremony, and pass the test.

[name="Lin Qingyan"]Have you undergone this test before?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4121_zuole_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Zuo Le"]I've applied many times... When the time is right, it will naturally be my turn.

[name="Yun Qingping"]I'm quite curious, Mr. Liang. Mr. Yi is practically a stranger to us, so why does he trust us so much?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1870_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Liang"]Enter the garden, and if fate decides you will meet him, you shall. You can ask him then.
[name="Liang"]Oh right, and while I did invite you for the Placation, this garden is also filled with many of Yi's treasures.
[name="Liang"]Only with the right eyes can a wonder be appreciated. As you ascend, why not consider this an outing, and take it leisurely?
[name="Liang"]But you will often find a 'person's' past behind an 'object', and some can be touched, but some are off limits. So do be careful and act accordingly.
[name="Liang"]I hope you can all accept these small tokens of appreciation.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4196_reckpr_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Yun Qingping"]What are these?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1870_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Liang"]Some special Tongbao. Think of them as little defensive amulets.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1043_leizi2_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Thank you, Mr. Liang. The rite will soon begin, so we shall be on our way.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1870_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Liang"]Do be careful.
