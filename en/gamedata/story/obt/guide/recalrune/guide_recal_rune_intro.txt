[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Doctor, Rhodes Island's reconstruction has been coming along fine, but I'm still a little worried. We'll only face even more difficult situations in future, so I was mulling over how we should keep our operators safe.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] So, I spent a few days making this thing—the Holographic Combat Matrix.
[Tutorial(target="pool_panel_stage", searchBtnInChildren=true,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] I got these after repairing the leftover battle records I got from the ship. Every batch is made from the toughest battles we've fought so far.
[Tutorial(target="pool_panel_reward", searchBtnInChildren=true,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Once you've reached a specific score, you and your operators will be awarded an engraved medal for your efforts. Keep collecting them, and you'll earn rewards at certain milestones.
[Tutorial(target="pool_btn_change_season", searchBtnInChildren=true,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] I'll compile more battle records on a regular basis and update the training data. Here you can check all the different batches and rewards.
[Tutorial(target="pool_btn_stage_1", searchBtnInChildren=true,            animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Try accessing the system and see how it works, Doctor.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Here you can select criteria to challenge your operators with.
[Tutorial(target="pool_part_stage_rune_select", animStyle="Highlight",           focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] There are multiple criteria to choose from, but just pick whichever you like, Doctor.
[Tutorial(target="pool_part_stage_rune_select", animStyle="Highlight",           focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Down here are additional criteria you can take on and earn their corresponding scores on a clear.
[Tutorial(target="pool_part_stage_rune_info", animStyle="Highlight",           focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Here, you can check the details of the selected criteria.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_closure")] Why don't you try a practice session now, Doctor?
