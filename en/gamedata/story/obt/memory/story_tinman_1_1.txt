[name="Tin Man"]You accepted that quickly. Why?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_523_1#1$1", focus="m")]
[name="Detective Mosby"]All I've accepted is the reality that I'm old. Columbia these days, you wake up to all kinds of new things every morning. I'm getting used to it.
[name="Detective Mosby"]If I can't bring myself to accept the changes the city is going through, I can still move to the frontier and live my life the way I want.
[name="Detective Mosby"]I'll bake cookies for my neighbors, chit-chat with the barkeep, instead of worrying about having my life ruined by some strangers.
[name="Detective Mosby"]And even the bandits there would at least leave me a bloody handprint at the crime scenes.
[name="Detective Mosby"]Every second I lived is pulling me back. I don't have the strength to change myself anymore.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4151_tinman_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Tin Man"]No one will blame a man for wanting to stay in the past, for being a pioneer of his own life.
[name="Tin Man"]That said, someone has got to look at what's ahead, isn't that right?
[name="Tin Man"]I am the poor man who must keep chasing tomorrow, as the place I must go is much farther away than tomorrow.

[name="Detective Mosby"]Thanks for talking all this over with me, Tin Man. It's a good thing you screwed up my last case today.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4151_tinman_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Tin Man"]And it's a good thing that I gave myself half a day of free time before my meetings. Otherwise, I would never have met the detective with the worst driving skills I've ever seen, witnessed the most realistic incident in this country, or revealed this well-hidden corner to the public.
[name="Tin Man"]I believe my work will unmask those who are currently evading justice. And to get there, I need the help of many more people like you.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4151_tinman_1#3$1",focus="m")]
[name="Tin Man"]Don't worry about tomorrow, Detective. Tomorrow always comes. Happy retirement.

The detective holds the unpublished book in one hand and the cup of coffee in the other, as though he is saluting someone.
Until the first ray of light spills through the window blinds and bathes him in a soft glow.
