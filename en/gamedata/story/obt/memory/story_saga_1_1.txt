Meanwhile, Saga, the wandering monk from Higashi, sets out from Baizao, traveling leisurely to the southwest.
After traveling over a hundred li, she looks back and can no longer see the Yanese capital, neither its silhouette nor the ruts from its traffic. As dusk falls, she suddenly sees houses, partly obscured, to the south.
As she gets closer, she sees an abandoned village: the houses are collapsed, weeds and trees are growing unchecked, wells and channels are clogged, and thick moss carpets the doorways.

[name="Saga"]This house looks still intact... and it even has a little garden.
[name="Saga"]Though the village is now abandoned, look how carefully the roads and houses were laid out. It must have been a prosperous settlement once.
[name="Saga"]I wonder how it was ruined... Catastrophe? Navigated off course? An issue with the Chidao? Something else?

[charslot]
The spring breeze is gentle and chilly. The cold light of the twin moons streams through the old window, casting grid-like shadows before Saga's feet. They overlap with the blurrier shadows of nearby trees, blending into a mottled pattern of light and shade.
Saga leans beneath the window, reflecting on the turning seasons and the impermanence of human affairs. Absentmindedly, she reaches to touch the shadow, and just as her fingertips meet the ground, she hears a strange sound—
The shadow under her fingers seems to shake along with her.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_362_saga_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="Saga"]Oh... I was so occupied with looking at the house that I forgot to eat.
[name="Saga"]The people of Baizao really know how to honor their food. There are so many varieties of dried provisions, and I purchased almost each one of them! Which should I taste first?
[name="Saga"]Even the plainest seasoned instant food smell delicious, and there's also coarse multi-grain meal, vacuum-packed tofu wraps, and self-heating mixed mushroom rice...

Saga mutters to herself as she listens intently to the sounds outside the wall. She stays pinned against the wall under the window as she quietly strafes toward the door.
Just as she's about to step outside, her movements are interrupted by two knocks.

The footsteps on the other side of the wall pause for a moment.
Then, a hand grips the door frame, the wrist bathed in moonlight as white as snow. A youthful Feline girl steps in, her skirt rustling softly. She is almond-eyed with jet-black hair, with a faint hint of shyness on her face.
Saga's nostrils flare slightly—a faint fragrance of pea blossoms. Strange. She hadn't noticed any pea vines left in this abandoned garden...

[name="Xiaoyu"]Good guess. My family name is Yuan, and we have always lived at the foot of Zuanjiang Peak. You may call me Xiaoyu.
[name="Xiaoyu"]I'm indeed on my way to the capital. I'm going to the Tianshi Bureau to find a Tianshi who... has been kind to my family.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_362_saga_1#7$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_141#1",focus="r")]
[name="Xiaoyu"]'Pay a debt of gratitude'? I wouldn't go that far. It's just that... my family is wealthy, so they were targeted by bandits. One of the Tianshis happened to be passing through and saved my family's lives.
[name="Xiaoyu"]My father and mother are both people who value gratitude, and they appreciated the Tianshi's kindness. Since it was New Year's, they sent a letter, along with some local specialties, to convey their thanks.
[name="Xiaoyu"]But they received no reply. They don't know if the package got lost in the mail or not. My parents are getting on in age. I didn't want them to worry about this, so I decided to go to Baizao and thank the Tianshi in person.
[name="Xiaoyu"]I never imagined that as I neared Baizao, I wouldn't even be able to see the city...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_362_saga_1#7$1",focus="l")]
[name="Saga"]I see. Baizao is on the march this month. I suspect thou hast ventured to the wrong stop? I made the same mistake myself on the road to Jiangqi.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_141#1",focus="r")]
[name="Xiaoyu"]On the march? Hmm... I know I should not ask this, since you just left Baizao... but... it's the first time I've ever left my home, and finding Baizao on my own has been such a difficult task...
[name="Xiaoyu"]If it wouldn't delay your journey, sister, would you take me to Baizao so I might seek an audience at the Tianshi Bureau? As long as I can get there, I shall empty my purse to you in thanks!
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_362_saga_1#4$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_362_saga_1#7$1",focus="l")]
[name="Saga"]This would not delay me! I am but a wandering monk with no fixed itinerary. I left Baizao but a few days ago, it would require very little effort to turn around and catch the city. Let me escort you to the capital—no need for compensation.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_141#2",focus="r")]
[name="Xiaoyu"]How could I possibly accept that, dear sister? Ever since I was little, my parents taught me that 'every kindness deserves a thanks'. If you hadn't agreed to take me along with you, I'd be lost in the wilderness, my very life at risk...
[name="Xiaoyu"]I simply have to repay a great kindness like that.

[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]I heard Xiaoyu mention getting 'separated from her family'. I think she got separated from the rest of the pea soldiers when the Tianshi summoned them and had to run to catch up with them.
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]The 'bloody mess' she mentioned, I think, was the battlefield she was summoned to. Perhaps she arrived late and saw only the post-battle carnage, and all the blood scared her back into pea form.
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]Typically, the Arts wear off after a few days, and the pea soldiers return to dust.

[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]...*sighs* It's a product of the Tianshi Bureau. How could I not know of it, being so close to the capital here?
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]The two of you met here by chance, so I thought maybe I should let you finish your journey, and then when you part ways, I'll sneak in and take her back to the Bureaus...

[name="Saga"]Thou knewest of the girl Yuan Yu for some time?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1626_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]Actually, no. I just knew that this pea soldier could never fulfill her wish.
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]It's been a hundred years since the last time there was a war in Shangshu and the Tianshis marched on the battlefield.
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]Pea soldiers have neither consciousness nor memories, and yet this one became self-aware, with her own 'struggle', her own 'adventure'...
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]She trudged all that way, from Shangshu to Baizao, enduring so many hardships, only to find that it was all... nothing.
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]What was the point?

[name="Saga"]Someone once told me that when we look at paintings, we think we are 'real people' looking at 'unreal people', but who is to say we are not the ones in the painting, our lives being drawn by some unseen hand?
[name="Saga"]There are many days when I think of those words, including this one.
[name="Saga"]Thou sayest that Xiaoyu traveled so far and suffered so much, only to discover it was all nothing.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_362_saga_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Saga"]And yet, I think...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_362_saga_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Saga"]It was not necessarily 'nothing'.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1626_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]However you want to put it, it doesn't change the ending.
[name="Tianshi Apprentice"]What can you do to change it?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_362_saga_1#7$1",focus="m")]
[name="Saga"]Xiaoyu gave herself a story—and for that story, she journeyed a thousand li. As this humble servant of Buddha accompanied her part of the way, I shall...
[name="Saga"]...Record this story.
