[name="Mother"]Claudia... there's something I've only just figured out—
[name="Mother"]I thought I figured it out a long time ago, but it's only now that I truly grasp how a single thing can have wildly different effects on different people.
[name="Mother"]I'm not sure why I've become so... cautious, all of a sudden.
[name="Mother"]Why I suddenly... fear these two words, words I've never feared before.
[name="Mother"]'Cheer up'... Will they become yet another burden on you?
[name="Mother"]......
[name="Mother"]Sometimes I feel like I'm under the influence of irrational emotion, whether hormones or nervous impulses, stress under extreme circumstances, behavioral patterns triggered by specific stimuli...
[name="Mother"]But nothing can explain—
[name="Mother"]Why I can't imagine seeing you suffer any more than you already have.
[name="Mother"]I'm an awful mother, aren't I? You're the one who actually got hurt, but here I am, moping.

[name="Mother"]Sorry, Claudia. Don't try to comfort me. That isn't your job.
[name="Mother"]Let's get back to our walk. It's been a long time since I've taken a stroll.

[charslot]
Claudia silently holds her mother's hand.
Will there be suffering...? But she has no time to continue this train of thought—
Two fowlbeasts come close to her, and one barges into the other. Startled, the second fowlbeast dives under her foot, almost getting stepped on. Claudia quickly lifts her foot and hops about on one leg.
The fowlbeast that was nearly trod upon flaps its wings a few times. Perhaps it's copying Claudia as she tries to balance on one foot?
For a moment, she believes it will start to fly—
But nothing happens. After a few flaps, it returns to jumping about like before, wanting to rub against her ankle.

Claudia lets go of her mother's hand, bending down to pick it up.
Perhaps because of the sudden change in elevation, the little fowlbeast begins to cower in fear. Claudia senses the warm ball of feathers trembling in her hand.
But eventually, it sticks its head back out, looking left, then right, then...
Is it looking up at the sky? Claudia wonders.

The weather is fine today. While there is still a touch of morning mist, it will soon be burned away by the sun's light.
There is a breeze. Claudia plucks some grass, then lets go. The blades fall, blown towards the southeast.
The fowlbeasts chirp as they follow her. Their 'mother' seems a bit different today...
But it's all the same to them. They jostle about behind her in blind imitation as usual.
She stops, and turns to face them. She asked her mother to stand at a distance, but before she sets off, she feels like she should... say something.
The fowlbeasts won't understand her, of course, but...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4165_ctrail_1#9$2",focus="m")]
[name="Claudia"]Hey, listen up...
[name="Claudia"]Today, we're going to learn how to fly.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4165_ctrail_1#8$2",focus="m")]
[name="Claudia"]Honestly, I'm thinking that even if I wasn't around, you might learn by imitating other fowlbeasts, or maybe your natural urges would have you spreading your wings.
[name="Claudia"]Even without an adult fowlbeast to guide you, you would still... fly all the same.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4165_ctrail_1#9$2",focus="m")]
[name="Claudia"]Once you can fly, you'll need to learn how to migrate. I'll take you into the typical migration path of your species.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4165_ctrail_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="Claudia"]Ideally, you'll already know how to fly when we find your flock. That way, you can keep up with them easily...

Claudia can sense the angle of the sunlight slowly rise, the temperature of the air and her body slowly rising with it.
The morning breeze blows past her. She begins to run, as if wanting to ride the wind.
She starts her flyer.
The earth whirls past below her, then behind her, slowly but steadily moving away from her.
She hears the flapping of wings behind her, louder and clearer than she imagined it would sound. Chirps turn into cries, vibrating as it passes through the air that lifts her. She can hear it all.

They climb, higher and higher.
She adjusts the nozzle angles and leans left and right. She knows she has traced a smooth curve up in the sky.
The soaring fowlbeasts behind her form a dotted line.
All her worries fall away, left behind on the ground to gradually shrink with everything else.
She simply enjoys the feeling of the wind, just like her very first flight.
As she passes by the shadow of a cloud, the question haunting her shadows her mind again.
'Despite everything, how long do you think you can keep flying like this?'
'Can you make it to the end?'
But it's strange.
Up here in the sky, amidst the clouds and the cawing of fowlbeasts, these questions that nearly suffocated her earlier are now as light as air.
As if you need only a single heartbeat to shake them away.
[name="Claudia"]What am I even thinking...?
[name="Claudia"]It's not like I ever believed it was a sure thing, even before the accident.
[name="Claudia"]It's always been this way... Always has been.
[name="Claudia"]I just want to... fly, that's all.
[name="Claudia"]Even if I can't fly to Rim Billiton, I can fly to Laterano, or Victoria...
[name="Claudia"]Even if I can't fly to Siesta, I can go to Kjerag, anywhere outside of Columbia really...
[name="Claudia"]I'll chart the route, bit by bit.
Another burst of fowlcry cuts through the air.
Claudia decides to treat it as a cry of approval.
