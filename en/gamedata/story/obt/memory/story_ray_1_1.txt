The sandbeast pack, of course, aren't able to answer the Cautus's question, even though she's wearing the same mushrooms and moss that they are.
They happily jostle to and fro, lighting up the mushrooms and moss hanging from their bodies, before ravenously gulping them down.
In the darkness the pack seems to float effortlessly across the desert, like a huge school of fins swimming slowly toward the glimmering moonlight.
Ray stands there, watching them.

Ray starts running... and her faint glow returns.
She catches up to the sandbeasts, like a wayward fin returning to its school.
