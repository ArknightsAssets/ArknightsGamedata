Day of the gathering

[name="Mischievous Child"]Can I plant something here, Clara? My teacher wants us to observe how seeds sprout. I brought the peas and cans!

[name="Composed Child"]Don't tell me you're trying to make canned peas sprout.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_240",focus="m")]
[name="Mischievous Child"]Don't be silly! I'm not stupid. My dad bought fresh peas from the grocery store!
[name="Mischievous Child"]Can I plant them, Clara? Can I?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Clara"]Of course, darling. There's some dirt piled up over there that you can use.

[name="Clara"]There aren't so many usually. They came because of the gathering...
[name="Clara"]I'm not by myself. The others take turns to come over and help. I don't have to go to work, so I have more time.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Clara"]...I went to his place a couple of days ago to tell him about the gathering, but he wasn't at home.
[name="Clara"]I left a message with his neighbor, but...
[name="Clara"]Is he avoiding me?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#9$1",focus="m")]

[name="Clara"]Talk... about what?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#9$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]Forming a family, the two of you.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Clara"]—!
[name="Clara"]Wh-What are you talking about?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]I'm not saying you have to form a family, but at least let him know that you like him. Don't keep everything in your heart.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Clara"]But people don't talk about these things at this age...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]What about 'this age'? It's not like your brain's stop working, or your heart's stop beating. You like being with him, care about him, and look all sullen when you don't see him. It's obvious, isn't it?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Clara"]People will gossip so much...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]And what about it? All the things that you and Ian have done at the association, what kind of person you are, it's there for everyone to see.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Clara"]Taking care of children is a good thing. This is different. It's so... shameful...

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]Are you saying that you're being 'shameful'?
[name="Catherine"]I know you. You always treat people sincerely, as you treat Ian.
[name="Catherine"]There's nothing shameful about being sincere.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]I know we're at 'this age', but all the more reason to go for what you want, while you can.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]You know what kind of man Ian is, don't you? Kind, gentle soul, just like you. Did you really think he would stay angry with you?

[name="Ian"]...
[name="Ian"]I... I wanted to have the association here because... because Clara is the one who cares for the children the most.
[name="Ian"]The other places were all too far from her home...
[name="Ian"]How much time would it take for her to go back and forth with her bad legs? What if she has an accident?
[name="Ian"]I... I was concerned for her, only to be told that I was being upsetting...

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1254_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Ian"]...I was out all day these few days, trying to come up with the money and see if I could negotiate with the factory owner...
[name="Ian"]Then I learned from Baldi this morning that you and Catherine had taken care of it!
[name="Ian"]He didn't dare play games when he saw Catherine, did he?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4162_cathy_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Catherine"]Depends on how you define 'playing games'.
[name="Catherine"]By the way, I think Clara has something to say to you.

Clara subconsciously clutches the edge of her jacket.
In that moment, it is as though the clock has been turned back forty years.
That day, Clara had clutched the edge of her white skirt in the same way, stuttering as she said the three magical words.
There are wrinkles all over her face now, but the expression upon it is no different from the young girl in the white dress forty years ago.
Clara opens her mouth, but no words come out.
It feels as though the air has become dense... then she hears Clara's voice.

[name="Ian"]O-Of course! I think you're really fine, really!

They say no more, their hands holding each other's tightly.
Catherine turns her head in the direction of the racket that the children are making.
The sky is overcast, but it seems to have gotten brighter than when it was an hour ago.
But of course, it is morning.
And the sun is rising.
