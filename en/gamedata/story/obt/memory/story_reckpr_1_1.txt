The rain keeps getting heavier. Listening to its falling raindrops, the boy calms down, without even realizing it. He focuses inward as usual, not noticing the water rising over his shoes.
The waterlogged earth feels unfamiliar underfoot, and even the twig feels slightly different in his hand. He absorbs it all, as the rain continues to fall.
Water flows over stone and moistens the soil below. I must harness that power and—
move the stone.
Yun opens his eyes. He has just shifted the rock, albeit by a small, nearly imperceptible distance. He lifts his head and gazes at the unending sky and the rain falling like rivers. He smiles, realizing that the rock was not as invincible as he thought.

Yun Qingping isn't surprised when he hears this. He inclines his head with a smile in acknowledgment. The elder gives him a long, deep bow, already carrying a subtle air of newfound mastery.
He departs with a loud laugh, fading into the deep forest without a trace. The room that used to ring with the sounds of practice is now utterly empty.
The owner of the house sits quietly for a moment, then rises, taking only a few possessions before setting off to wander once more. He leaves behind only one thing: an old sword, slanted against the fading sunlight.
