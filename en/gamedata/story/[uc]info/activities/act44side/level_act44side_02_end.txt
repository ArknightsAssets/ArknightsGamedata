Late one night, an exhausted Hoshiguma comes face-to-face with an entity of kaidan legend known as the Wanyuudou. While tracking it, she encounters Moriuchi, an oden yatai owner. Meanwhile, the TV in Momoka's home suddenly begins showing a horrifying scene: her assistant Mio being coerced into plotting her murder. Worse still, not long afterward, Mio appears on Momoka's doorstep.
