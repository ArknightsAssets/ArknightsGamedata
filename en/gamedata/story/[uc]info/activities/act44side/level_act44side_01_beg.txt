Detective Koretou of the Mitsukue police targets Hoshiguma as his prime suspect in a twenty-year-old murder case, but the statute of limitations has already expired. Hoshiguma's return to Mitsukue has nothing to do with the case—it's because of a letter from Tessai, the head of the Kinsekikai yakuza clan, a man like a second father to her. The police are left scratching their heads, while Kouhei Mifune, another Kinsekikai yakuza, shows up at the police station and pulls Hoshiguma out.
